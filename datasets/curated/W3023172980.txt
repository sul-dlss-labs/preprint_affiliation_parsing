The Noise Collector for sparse recovery in high dimensions Miguel Moscoso ∗ , Alexei Novikov † , George Papanicolaou ‡ , Chrysoula Tsogka § August 14, 2019 Abstract arXiv:1908.04412v1 [eess.SP] 5 Aug 2019 The ability to detect sparse signals from noisy high-dimensional data is a top priority in modern science and engineering. A sparse solution of the linear system A ρ = b 0 can be found efficiently with an l 1 -norm minimization approach if the data is noiseless. Detection of the signal’s support from data corrupted by noise is still a challeng- ing problem, especially if the level of noise must be estimated. We propose a new efficient approach that does not require any parame- ter estimation. We introduce the Noise Collector (NC) matrix C and solve an augmented system A ρ + C η = b 0 + e , where e is the noise. We show that the l 1 -norm minimal solution of the augmented system has zero false discovery rate for any level of noise and with probabil- ity that tends to one as the dimension of b 0 increases to infinity. We also obtain exact support recovery if the noise is not too large, and develop a Fast Noise Collector Algorithm which makes the computa- tional cost of solving the augmented system comparable to that of the original one. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in applications to passive array imaging. ∗ Department of Mathematics, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Leganes, Madrid 28911, Spain † Department of Mathematics, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802 ‡ Department of Mathematics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305 § Department of Applied Mathematics, University of California, Merced, CA 95343
