{"text":"We present a tensor-decomposition method to solve the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) in the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook approximation.

We use this method to predict the equilibrium distribution (steady-state simulation) and a non-equilibrium distribution returning to the equilibrium (transient simulation). Our numerical experiments demonstrate N log N scaling.

{"text":"Whenever the mean free path of molecules becomes larger than the characteristic length scale of a system, the continuity assumption breaks down and so does the validity of the Navier-Stokes equations. This phenomenon occurs in a number of settings, including splashing droplets [1], moving contact lines [2], super- and hyper-sonic flows [3], and flow of electrons in metals [4] and silicon [5]. The physics in this flow regime is often described by the six-dimensional (plus time) Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) [6].","meta":{"openalex_id":"W2982798447","block_id":8},"_input_hash":1292105160,"_task_hash":-915767489,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734030773,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14","_session_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14"}
{"text":"Like many other high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), the BTE suffers from the curse of dimensionality: the computational cost of conventional numerical schemes, such as those based on tensor product representations, grows exponentially with an increasing number of degrees of freedom. One way to mitigate such computational complexity is to use particle-based methods [7], e.g., direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) [8] or the Nambu-Babovsky method [9]. These methods preserve the main physical properties of the system, even far from equilibrium, and are computationally efficient away from near-fluid regimes. In particular, they have low memory requirements and their cost scales linearly with the number of particles. However, their accuracy, efficiency and convergence rate tend to be poor for non-stationary flows, or flows close to continuum regimes [10, 11, 12]. This is due to the non-negligible statistical fluctuations associated with finite particle numbers, which are difficult and expensive to filter out in such flow regimes [10, 13]. While several general purpose algorithms have been proposed, the most efficient techniques are problem","meta":{"openalex_id":"W2982798447","block_id":9},"_input_hash":-1142089192,"_task_hash":-1140995672,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734030774,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14","_session_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14"}

{"text":"We present a new algorithm based on tensor decompositions to solve the BTE in the BhatnagarGross-Krook (BGK) approximation [17]. The algorithm relies on canonical tensor expansions [18], combined with either alternating direction least squares methods [19, 20, 21, 22] or alternating direction Galerkin methods [23, 24] or any other version of the method of mean weighted residuals (MWR) [25]. Unlike the BTE-specific numerical techniques, tensor-decomposition methods are general-purpose, i.e., they can be applied to other high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs [26, 27], including but not limited to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation [28], the Fokker-Planck equation [29], and the Vlasov equation [30, 31, 32]. This opens the possibility to use tensor methods in many research fields including chemical reaction networks in turbulent flows [33], neuroscience [34], and approximation of functional differential equations [24]. Recently, we developed the tensordecomposition method [18] to solve a linearized BGK equation. In this paper, we extend it to the full BTE in the BGK approximation, i.e., to obviate the need for the assumption of small fluctuations and to allow for variable density, velocity, temperature, and collision frequency fields.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W2982798447","block_id":15},"_input_hash":-1146093635,"_task_hash":1525675391,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734030814,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14","_session_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14"}

We start by validating our solver on a prototype problem involving the Boltzmann-BGK equation in one spatial dimension. Then we consider simulations of the full Boltzmann-BGK equation in three spatial dimensions. The 3D numerical results are split up into steady-state transient problems. The steady-state problem is used to validate the code against an analytical equilibrium solution to the Boltzmann transport equation. It also enables us to investigate the error convergence as function of various parameters, and the code performance as function of the number of collocation points and the number of processor cores. The transient problem starts with an initial distribution away from equilibrium, including a non-zero average velocity in the x 1 direction, and looks at temporal evolution of the PDF f . We compare our code with a spectral code in 2D and present the results for the full 6D Boltzmann-BGK equation.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W2982798447","block_id":125},"_input_hash":-260562389,"_task_hash":-1992610193,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734030917,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14","_session_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14"}

This extends the usage of this method from only fully separable differential operators, to partially separable operators. The dependent variables in the Boltzmann equation are computed via the pseudo-spectral method with collocation points. The different dimensions are solved using a parallel ALS algorithm. Our numerical experiments show that the code is capable of simulating both a system's steady state and its temporal evolution starting from a state far away from equilibrium.

{"text":"Generalizations to other types of boundary conditions would require an in-depth investigation of the trial function behavior. The choice of a right trial function for a certain system is typically determined by one of the two approaches. First, one selects a trial function that obeys the desired boundary conditions and then sums over the trial functions to reconstruct the solution to a PDE. Second, one selects a trial function that captures the PDE solution and then adds trial functions to reconstruct the boundary condition. Figure 8 shows that the six-dimensional Boltzmann equation subject to periodic boundary conditions can be efficiently solved by using the discrete Fourier series. The presence of, e.g., a wall would introduce the Maxwell boundary condition [35, 66]. The latter consists of two parts: one represents the reflection of particles from the wall and the other represents absorption and emission of particles on the wall. Since there is no known trial function to either solve the Boltzmann equation in the bulk or the Maxwell boundary condition on the wall, another method of the trial-function selection is needed. Such methods include the tau method [67], the penalty approach [68], and the mixed method [69, 70, 71]. They have been used to implement boundary condition for the weighted residuals and spectral methods [72, 68], but have not yet been applied in the tensor decomposition setting.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W2982798447","block_id":185},"_input_hash":-375665867,"_task_hash":296280359,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734030969,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14","_session_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14"}
{"text":"While the boundary conditions are very important for engineering applications, some fundamental questions remain to be resolved as well. The empirical evidence shows convergence the tensor algorithms, but its theoretical proof is lacking. That is largely due to two factors. First, it is generally assumed that increasing the rank of the solution improves its accuracy and in, some cases, tensor decomposition was shown to be exponentially more efficient than one would expect a priori [22]. However, there is no mathematical proof which indicates how high the rank needs to be to reach a certain accuracy and how fast the solution converges as a function of its rank. This question is very important for the speed of tensor decomposition, because the higher the rank of the operators and the solution of the Boltzmann equation, the slower the computation becomes. Second, from one time step to the next convergence is not guaranteed. The ALS method implemented in our code is a variation on the Gauss-Seidel method whose convergence can be proven for some specific cases [54]. However, only the Jacobi method can decouple the different dimensions and parallelize the algorithm. How the adoption of this method would change convergence remains to be investigated.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W2982798447","block_id":186},"_input_hash":913686983,"_task_hash":1863394563,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734030970,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14","_session_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14"}

Afterwards the squared velocity fluctuation fields are decomposed using CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition [S9] in the decompose subroutine. The decomposition goes significantly faster if an initial guess is chosen to be close to the final answer. Therefore the decomposition result of the previous time step is passed on as the initial guess when calling the decompose subroutine. Using the decomposed velocity fluctuation fields, the temperature and collision frequency are computed in computeTemperature and computeFrequency , respectively.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W2982798447","block_id":278},"_input_hash":1717258604,"_task_hash":-1878605263,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734031043,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14","_session_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14"}

First the operators A -and A + are applied to \u03b2 Old and \u03b2 New , respectively, using subroutine computeG . The reason \u03b2 New is repeated R Exp times is that eventually \u03b2 New is combined with the Kruskal operator Exp with rank R Exp , which is a representation of trial function \u03c6 s . After operators A -and A + are applied, \u03b2 Old and \u03b2 New are multiplied with each other. The mtimeskBlock subroutine is used to make sure that both are multiplied one rank at a time. The next step performs integration for each dimension. This is possible because decomposition has made the different dimensions independent of each other. The next block of code incorporates the trial function multiplied with A + into the subroutine. For each dimension the Kruskal operator Exp A + ( d ) is two-dimensional and \u03b2 Old is reshaped to match this before multiplying the two using mtimeskBlock . The next two lines integrate over the first dimension so only the wave number is left as a variable. The last block of code combines the results of the above shown calculations.

{"text":"The last subroutine computeArrayM1 , shown in Algorithm 9, computes array M 1 , the second and last array needed to enforce continuity. Like subroutine computeArrayM0 , this subroutine is also parallelized and the dimension d gets passed on to the subroutine to indicate for which dimension array M 1 is computed. Like array N 1 , this array also consists of four blocks but this time representing: n Eq, New \u00b7 n Eq, New , n Eq, New \u00b7 nU New , nU New \u00b7 n Eq, New , and nU New \u00b7 nU New . The term representing nU New is computed using computeG and the term representing n Eq, New is computed using krepelem and computeF . Because M 1 is a 2D array with one wave number for each dimension, Exp is expanded to three dimensions with two different mappings Exp 2 and Exp 3 . These two mappings are appended with the different components of \u03b2 New ( dd ) for dimensions d glyph[negationslash] = dd . The next step is integration over velocity phase space, rank by rank multiplication of the two resulting fields, and integration over position phase space to create a two-dimensional array. The next part of the algorithm maps the different rank combinations, which result from the multiplication n Eq, New \u00b7 n Eq, New , onto different parts of array M 1 . For the other three blocks described above the same procedure is followed resulting in the complete computation of array M 1 , which is returned at the end of the subroutine.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W2982798447","block_id":302},"_input_hash":172591903,"_task_hash":1630027331,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734031054,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14","_session_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14"}

{"text":"conservation backlash (Holmes and Cavanagh, 2016; West et al., 2006; West and Brockington, 2006). Acknowledging these negative consequences has led to a greater recognition of the need to pay attention to the social aspects of planning and ongoing management of conservation initiatives. There has been subsequent calls for the 'mainstreaming of the social sciences in conservation' (Bennett et al., 2017b). The conservation social sciences are a rigorous set of disciplines, theories and methods for systematically understanding and characterizing the human dimensions to facilitate evidence-based conservation (see Bennett et al., 2017a; Charnley et al., 2017; Moon and Blackman, 2014). While the potential contributions of the conservation social sciences are vast, we are concerned that too much of the current attention is on research that serves an instrumental purpose, by which we mean that the social sciences are used to justify and promote status quo conservation practices. The reasons for engaging the social sciences, as well as the arts and the humanities, go well beyond making conservation more effective.

{"text":"First, the set of topics that are examined by conservation social scientists needs to be expanded exponentially. The 'human dimensions' include an exceedingly broad set of social, economic, cultural, health, political and governance considerations. Yet, despite the wide array of potential sub-topics that might be included under each of these areas of consideration, some social science topics continue to receive substantially more attention than others. For example, topics such as economic and non-economic valuation of nature, behavior change, management effectiveness, enforcement, and human-wildlife interactions are highly represented in the conservation literature. We posit that these topics receive more attention because they are instrumental to conservation and management actions. They serve a clear purpose: to justify conservation and improve environmental outcomes. Topics such as governance, culture, social impacts, politics, power relations, ethics, narratives and knowledge receive significantly less attention. Many conservation scientists and practitioners may find these areas of research more demanding, as results and insights could challenge status quo conservation practice or lead to questions about the underlying philosophy of conservation. Social science might reveal hidden economic or political agendas (Gray et al., 2014; Harris, 2014) or problematic ideologies, visions or values that are producing conflict and undermining conservation (Chan et al., 2016; Doak et al., 2014). However, we believe that conservationists should not be afraid to engage with challenging or critical social science scholarship on conservation, as these ideas may produce more transformative insights into how to adaptively manage and improve conservation policy and practice. Critical appraisals may inspire novel insights while leading to more constructive solutions. This will require respectful dialogue between those examining","meta":{"openalex_id":"W2887090792","block_id":14},"_input_hash":803031792,"_task_hash":-398510222,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734031144,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14","_session_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14"}

{"text":"Second, the arts and humanities have an exceedingly important role to play in conservation (Holm et al., 2015). Without the arts and the contemplation of ethics, conservation may veer towards the ugly and the unethical. Let us not forget the often highly colonial, disruptive and even violent history of conservation (Brockington and Igoe, 2006; Sandlos, 2007) - which has led to the critiques of the social impacts of conservation mentioned earlier. The arts and humanities can provide us with the concepts and techniques to innovate and re-imagine a more socially just, culturally appropriate and, indeed, beautiful way of imagining and achieving conservation (Brennan, 2018; Holm et al., 2015; Polfus et al., 2017). What we are refering to here is the full transformative potential of conservation, which is already an act of resistance. Conservation, we propose, is not a practice limited to a particular place and time but rather one that asks us all to rethink our relationship to nature in ways that lead to the production of healthy environments for humans and non-humans alike. We can learn something here from the work of Indigenous scholars reflecting on Indigenous ways of knowing and viewing human-environment relationships as rooted in deep respect for 'all our relations' across multiple generations (Kimmerer, 2013). Art in a more conventional sense also has the ability to transform our relationship to nature, making us reflect in ways that busy lives do not normally allow for. There is overwhelming evidence that our sense of connection to nature profoundly effects our willingness to protect it (Nisbet et al., 2009). Art, the humanities and philosophy can help us to reconnect and be inspired again.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W2887090792","block_id":16},"_input_hash":-1008034336,"_task_hash":-1506513653,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734031146,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14","_session_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14"}

As diverse teams are constituted to deliver real world solutions to pressing conservation problems, we hope that social scientists, artists and humanities scholars are amongst those represented. However, just as we are asking conservation practitioners and scientists to be willing to grapple with different ideas and types of challenges, so too social scientists, artists and humanities scholars will need to reconsider their way of engaging. Social scientists may need to get better at working in teams, at integrating ideas with other disciplines and pracitioner knowledges, and at communicating their research to diverse audiences of practitioners and policy-makers.

However, without greater investments and mindful engagement, the potential contributions of the social sciences, arts and humanities to conservation will not be realized. Key conservation bodies (e.g., IUCN, CBD) and policy processes (e.g., IPCC, IPBES) could benefit from greater capacity in social science. Why not also have artists or ethicists in residence? Similarly, conservation NGOs and government agencies responsible for environmental management would benefit from hiring social scientists as they pursue their mandates. Conservation journals (such as this one) also need to be open to, and even actively encourage, publications that address a broader and more innovative set of social science, arts and humanities papers than is typically within their purview. Moving the conservation social sciences, arts and humanities beyond the margin in conservation science will increase their potential to transform conservation paradigms, programs, policies and practices and humanity's relationship to nature, which is arguably the intent of the conservation movement.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W2887090792","block_id":19},"_input_hash":812279582,"_task_hash":393300456,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734031148,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14","_session_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14"}

{"text":"Objective: Prior studies indicate lower employment and greater difficulty securing reemployment among individuals who smoke or are overweight. In an anonymous online survey, we examined willingness to hire candidates who smoke cigarettes or are overweight for different job types and tested respondents' smoking history and body weight as moderating factors. Methods: Employed U.S. adults ( N = 1107) were recruited online in 2019-2020. Respondents indicated their willingness to hire and hiring preferences for six different job roles in reference to 8 different attributes, which included smoking and overweight status. Analyses tested differences by job-type and respondents' own smoking and overweight status. Results: Percent willing to hire candidates who smoke (are overweight) was 7.6% (40.3%) for health aide, 15.3% (66.2%) for receptionist, and 53.6% (58.1%) for groundskeeper. Ever-smoker respondents were more likely than never smokers to be willing to hire candidates who smoke (Odds Ratios [OR] = 1.983.00) and less likely to identify smoking as a least preferred attribute ( p s < .009). Overweight respondents were more likely than non-overweight respondents to be willing to hire overweight candidates (OR = 1.47-1.99) and less likely to identify overweight as a least preferred attribute ( p s < .002). Moderating effects of respondent smoking or overweight status were greater for the public-facing receptionist versus groundskeeper position. Conclusions: In hypothetical hiring decisions, smoking and overweight were viewed as undesirable, particularly among respondents without the attribute tested.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4205859241","block_id":37},"_input_hash":1357060932,"_task_hash":-1664496667,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734031231,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14","_session_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14"}

{"text":"Smoking and risk behaviors related to adiposity (e.g., poor nutrition, physical inactivity) are detrimental to health and also may negatively affect financial wellbeing. Prior studies indicate cigarette smoking and overweight status each are associated with being unemployed and with difficulty securing reemployment. Nationally, in 2018, 37.6% of unemployed adults reported past-month tobacco use, compared to 20.0% of those with part-time employment and 25.0% of those with full-time employment (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2019). In a one-year observational study with propensity score analysis, jobseekers who did not smoke were 30% more likely to attain employment than those who smoked (Prochaska et al., 2016). Similarly, U.S. adults with obesity are about 1.5 times more likely to be unemployed than adults without obesity (Le Strat et al., 2020). The association between unemployment and obesity persists after accounting for physical and psychiatric comorbidities (Le Strat et al., 2020).","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4205859241","block_id":42},"_input_hash":975017894,"_task_hash":-1720201978,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734031234,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14","_session_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14"}
{"text":"Once considered commonplace, smoking in the U.S. today is denormalized and stigmatized (Stuber et al., 2008). Unemployed jobseekers describe perceptible signs of smoking, such as stained teeth and the smell of cigarette smoke, as barriers to employment (Michalek et al., 2020). Employers across the US have increasingly adopted policies of not hiring job candidates who smoke (Legault & Pasternak, 2020). Overweight people are not protected from employment discrimination under U.S. federal law, and only the state of Michigan prohibits discrimination at the state level (Miller, 2019).

{"text":"Cigarette smoking and overweight status may have a greater influence on hiring decisions for job roles that are public-facing and in the health sector. Hiring managers may be concerned that an employee who smokes or is overweight will be viewed poorly by the public, due to the high prevalence of smoking stigma (Evans-Polce et al., 2015) and weight stigma (Spahlholz et al., 2016). Moreover, a job candidate for a position in the healthcare industry who uses tobacco or is overweight may be viewed as running counter to the company's pro-health mission. An experimental study of simulated hiring decisions found that participants with negative attitudes toward smoking viewed candidates who smoked more negatively than candidates who did not smoke, for both public- and non-public facing job roles (Roulin & Bhatnagar, 2018). Similarly, an experimental study of weight stigma found that heavier candidates were viewed as less hireable than thinner candidates. The difference in hireability between thinner female and heavier female candidates was greater for public-facing than non-public facing roles (Nickson et al., 2016).

Social categorization based on attributes is an integral component of stigma. People with a stigmatized attribute (e.g., smoking) are considered part of a group that shares that attribute. Stigma is perpetuated when stereotypes are assigned to the stigmatized group (Biernat & Dovidio, 2000). People show preference for members of their ingroup (Tajfel, 1982), and stigmatized people often protect their self-concepts by selectively valuing the positive abilities and outcomes of their ingroup (Crocker & Major,","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4205859241","block_id":48},"_input_hash":418368143,"_task_hash":267148864,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734031236,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14","_session_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14"}

{"text":"In the current study, presented with hypothetical hiring decisions, we hypothesized that respondents would express unwillingness to hire candidates who smoke cigarettes or are overweight. Smoking and overweight are both common and visible stigmatized attributes that are related to health and may be considered inconsistent with the mission of certain employment settings (e.g., healthcare). We anticipated that unwillingness to hire candidates who smoke or are overweight would be strongest for health-oriented (e.g., health aide) and public-facing (e.g., receptionist) occupations relative to other roles (e.g., groundskeeper). We further hypothesized that respondents' personal profile on the attributes of interest would have a moderating effect matched on smoking or overweight status. That is, respondents' ever smoking status would be specifically associated with willingness to hire candidates who smell of cigarette smoke and respondents' overweight status would be specifically associated with willingness to hire an overweight candidate; however, the moderating effect would be dampened for occupations that are health-oriented and public-facing. Given that the data are observational, we controlled for additional respondent characteristics that may relate to perceptions of smoking and overweight status in hiring decisions including gender, age, and employment in the health industry. We also considered active participation in hiring decisions in one's workplace.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4205859241","block_id":52},"_input_hash":73966894,"_task_hash":600213022,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734031237,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14","_session_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14"}

{"text":"Several societal issues could be mitigated by reducing global consumption of meat and animal products (MAP). In three randomized, controlled experiments ( n = 217 to 574 ), we evaluated the effects of a documentary that presents health, environmental, and animal welfare motivations for reducing participants' reported MAP consumption. Study 1 assessed the documentary's effectiveness after 12 days using methodological innovations designed to minimize social desirability bias, a widespread limitation of past research. Study 2 investigated discrepancies between the results of Study 1 and the results of previous studies by further examining the role of social desirability bias. Study 3 assessed the documentary's effectiveness in a new population anticipated to be more responsive and upon enhancing the intervention content. We found that the documentary did not decrease MAP consumption when potential social desirability bias was minimized (Studies 1 and 3). The documentary also did not affect reported consumption among participants whose demographics suggested they might be more receptive (Study 3). However, the documentary did substantially increase intentions to reduce consumption, consistent with past studies (Studies 2 and 3). Overall, we conclude that some past studies of similar interventions may have overestimated effects due to methodological biases. Novel intervention strategies to reduce MAP consumption may be needed.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4232006839","block_id":16},"_input_hash":1631326296,"_task_hash":2058641585,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734031349,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14","_session_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14"}

{"text":"This research has a number of methodological and conceptual strengths. To help mitigate 529 widespread limitations of previous research regarding the potential for social desirability 530 bias [17], we introduced methodological innovations to help prevent and benchmark social 531 desirability bias in studies of reported food outcomes. First, in the 2 longitudinal studies 532 (Studies 1 and 3), we used nai\u0308ve re-recruitment to conceal the purpose of the study. We also 533 included decoy foods (e.g., sweetened beverages) in the outcome measurements. Awareness 534 probes in these studies indicated that, with these methods, participants indeed remained 535 largely unaware of the purpose of the experiment during follow-up data collection. In Study 536 2, as a benchmark of the severity of social desirability bias, we investigated 'retrospective 537 causation' by asking participants to report on their past-week consumption, mere minutes 538 after they had viewed either the documentary or the control video. Any apparent intervention 539 effects on reported consumption over the week prior to random assignment would appear to 540 reflect social desirability bias. We estimated that the documentary affected these retrospective 541 reports of total consumption by -4 . 07 oz/week (95% CI: [ -11 . 74 , 3 . 60 ]). Although the 542 confidence interval is wide, this point estimate is in the vicinity of typical intervention effects 543 seen in studies of interventions to reduce meat consumption, most of which had similar 544 designs that are susceptible to social desirability bias [17]. 545","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4232006839","block_id":280},"_input_hash":1489283245,"_task_hash":1360656082,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734031456,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14","_session_id":"2024-12-12_11-12-14"}

{"text":"This research also has limitations. Although our findings seem to rule out the possibility 557 of large intervention effects, smaller intervention effects may nevertheless be consequential if 558 a large number of individuals were exposed to the intervention, or if effects accumulated over 559 repeated exposures [76]. Indeed, we intentionally selected an intervention that has already 560 been widely disseminated at relatively low cost. However, it is difficult to precisely establish 561 small intervention effects without very large sample sizes and high retention. Although 562 Study 1 achieved high retention, Study 3 did not, which compromises statistical precision 563 and increases susceptibility to missing data bias. Additionally, reported dietary data can be 564 subject to substantial measurement error even when collected via measures such as 24-hour 565 recalls or food frequency questionnaires [77, 78]; such measurement error can further obscure 566 small intervention effects.

{"text":"ABSTRACT: A compound bound covalently to an enzyme active site can act either as a substrate if the covalent linkage is readily broken up by the enzyme or as an inhibitor if the bond dissociates slowly. We tracked the reactivity of such bonds associated with the rise of the resistance to penicillin G (PenG) in protein evolution from penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) to TEM \u03b2 -lactamases, and with the development of avibactam (Avb) to overcome the resistance. We found that the ester linkage in PBP-PenG is resistant to hydrolysis mainly due to the small electric fields present in the protein active site. Conversely, the same linkage in the descendant TEM-PenG experiences large electric fields which stabilize the more charge-separated transition state and thus lower the free energy barrier to hydrolysis. Specifically, the electric fields were improved from 59 to -140 MV/cm in an ancient evolution dating back billions of years, contributing 5 orders of magnitude rate acceleration. This trend continues today in the nullification of newly developed antibiotic drugs.  The fast linkage hydrolysis acquired from evolution is counteracted by the upgrade of PenG to Avb whose linkage escapes from the hydrolysis by returning to a low-field environment. Using the framework of electrostatic catalysis, the electric field, an observable from vibrational spectroscopy, provides a unifying physical metric to understand protein evolution and to guide the design of covalent drugs.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4304614191"},"_input_hash":1021919440,"_task_hash":1803630530,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734039845,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}
{"text":"Resistance to \u03b2 -lactam antibiotics arises from the remarkable proficiency of \u03b2 -lactamases in breaking up \u03b2 -lactam rings. 1-3 TEM-1, a prototypical \u03b2 -lactamase, has perfected the degradation of penicillin G (PenG) by first using the hydroxyl group of S70 to open the \u03b2 -lactam ring, forming an ester bond that ties PenG in the covalent complex TEM-PenG (Figure 1A). 4 The ester bond is then subject to a nucleophilic attack from a well-positioned water molecule assisted by a general base E166. The rapid hydrolysis of the ester linkage quickly releases TEM-1 from the covalent adduct so that another catalytic transformation can queue up. By contrast, the same ester hydrolysis is sluggish in the active site of penicillin binding proteins (PBPs), trapping PBPs in the covalent complex PBP-PenG (Figure 1B). 5-7 The covalently trapped PBPs can no longer act as DDpeptidases in the biosynthesis of the bacterial peptidoglycan cell wall, leading to the antibiotic effect of PenG. Thus, PenG switches its role from being a covalent inhibitor for PBP to being a substrate for TEM-1 due to the disparity in the rate of ester hydrolysis.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4304614191"},"_input_hash":-1652123667,"_task_hash":1225807183,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734039846,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}
{"text":"This shift in hydrolysis rate is an outcome of protein evolution, with a history far beyond the antibiotic era, dating back billions of years when ancient microbes acquired the capability to secrete PenG to kill other microbes for survival. 8 In response, defense against PenG emerged from the evolution of PBPs into \u03b2 -lactamases, which confers the enzyme machinery with a hydrolysis apparatus. 6 Compared with PBP-A, currently the closest known evolutionary ancestor, 9 TEM-1 retains the protein scaffold, consensus sequences in the active site, and fast bonding to PenG, yet features a longer \u2126 -loop bearing the key E166 in the place of L158 for carrying out the ester hydrolysis. 10 To circumvent this biochemical defense harnessed by pathogens, avibactam (Avb) has been developed as a drug which effectively reverses protein evolution and traps TEM-1 in the covalent complex TEM-Avb (Figure 1B). 11-12 The upgrade from PenG to Avb prohibits TEM-1 from  executing  the  hydrolysis  necessary  to  free  TEM  from  covalent  inhibition.

{"text":"This work reports a dynamical Markov state model of CLC-2 'fast' (pore) gating, based on 600 microseconds of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. In the starting conformation of our CLC-2 model, both outer and inner channel gates are closed. The first conformational change in our dataset involves rotation of the inner-gate backbone along residues S168-G169-I170. This change is strikingly similar to that observed in the cryo-EM structure of the bovine CLC-K channel, though the volume of the intracellular (inner) region of the ion conduction pathway is further expanded in our model. From this state (inner gate open and outer gate closed), two additional states are observed, each involving a unique rotameric flip of the outer-gate residue GLU ex . Both additional states involve conformational changes that orient GLU ex away from the extracellular (outer) region of the ion conduction pathway. In the first additional state, the rotameric flip of GLU ex results in an open, or near-open, channel pore. The equilibrium population of this state is low ( \u223c 1%), consistent with the low open probability of CLC-2 observed experimentally in the absence of a membrane potential stimulus (0 mV). In the second additional state, GLU ex rotates to occlude the channel pore. This state, which has a low equilibrium population ( \u223c 1%), is only accessible when GLU ex is protonated. Together, these pathways model the opening of both an inner and outer gate within the CLC-2 selectivity filter, as a function of GLU ex protonation. Collectively, our findings are consistent with published experimental analyses of CLC-2 gating and provide a high-resolution structural model to guide future investigations.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3013783484"},"_input_hash":-1829124313,"_task_hash":1726036811,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734039861,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

The first CLC structure solved, a prokaryotic H + /Cl -exchange transporter [13], proved relevant for guiding structure-function studies on a wide range of CLCs, including eukaryotic CLC channels [15,16,18,19]. The mechanistic similarities between channels and transporters, which have been discussed and studied extensively, provide strong justification for using CLC transporter structures to understand CLC channel structure and function [8,20]. The CLC transporter structures represent a closed conformational state in which bound chloride (Cl -) is occluded by proteinaceous 'gates' that block exit to either the outer (extracellular) or inner (intracellular) side of the protein. The outer gate is formed in part by a conserved glutamate residue, GLU ex [21-28] (Fig. 1). When mutated to GLN (to resemble the protonated GLU), this side chain rotates outwards and partially unblocks the Cl -permeation pathway [21].

{"text":"Following the completion of the simulation studies described herein, the structures of two mammalian CLC channels were published, bovine CLC-K (bCLC-K) and human CLC-1 (hCLC-1) [32,33]. These structures are highly similar to the transporter structures, but with subtle structural differences that result in wider anion permeation pathways at both the extracellular and intracellular gates. In the bCLC-K structure, widening at the extracellular gate is due to the replacement of GLU ex with a neutral VAL residue. In CLC-1, widening at the extracellular pore entrance instead results from outward rotation of GLU ex . At the intracellular side, widening of the Cl -permeation pathway is accomplished in one of two ways. In the bCLC-K structure, the loop containing SER cen undergoes a conformational change such that the SER cen side chain rotates to unblock the pore. In the hCLC-1 structure, no rotation of SER cen occurs. Rather, expansion of the intracellular pore entrance results from the smaller volume of residues in this region. While these new structures provide invaluable molecular detail for understanding the gating mechanisms of CLC channel homologs compared to their transporter counterparts, many questions remain. What, for example, is the conformation of the CLC-K closed state, given that it does not have a GLU ex gate? Does the intracellular conformational change seen in CLC-K (the rotation of the conserved SER-containing loop) occur also in CLC-1 (and CLC-2) to further widen the pore?

{"text":"In this study, we investigate the molecular dynamics (MD) of CLC-2, a mammalian chloride ion channel with broad tissue and organ distribution [49,108]. The widespread physiological importance of CLC-2 is reflected by the severe phenotype of knockout animals, which exhibit male infertility, blindness, leukodystrophy, and decreased intestinal Cl -absorption [113-115]. In humans, CLC-2 defects are linked to leukodystrophies [108], and gain-of-function mutations result in primary aldosteronism [116]. Despite the links of CLC-2 malfunction to human disease, many aspects of CLC-2 physiology remain uncertain. For instance, while CLC-2 is the most broadly expressed voltage-gated chloride channel in the brain, the details of its role in neuronal excitability and/or chloride homeostasis [55-63] are controversial [3,62,64,65]. A precise understanding of the atomic interactions and rearrangements involved in channel activation will facilitate understanding of CLC-2 physiological behavior and its role in human disease.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3013783484"},"_input_hash":1964094672,"_task_hash":2142640282,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734039873,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}
{"text":"The spatial and temporal resolution afforded by computer simulations allows for the atom-scale examination of protein structure and function. Here we apply MD simulations and Markov State Modeling to study the conformational dynamics of CLC-2 gating. Markov State Models (MSMs) allow for the rigorous statistical characterization of biophysical simulations [66-69]. Prior to constructing the MSM, the simulation data is first transformed into its kinetically slowest representation via the method of time-structure based independent component analysis (tICA) [70-72]. Such a transformation allows identification of the slowest conformational changes in an MD dataset - those most likely to correspond to channel gating. The MSM is then built over these conformational changes, and queried to predict the thermodynamics and kinetics of CLC-2 channel activation. Our MSM indicates that the top activation pathway for our CLC-2 model begins in the closed state, near the template structure on which we based our model. The slowest timescale conformational change involves the rotation of the backbone along the S168-G169-I170 residues at the intracellular entrance to the ion conduction pathway. The second major motion describes the flip of the GLU ex side chain on the extracellular vestibule. This flip of the GLU ex side chain displays a sensitivity to residue protonation that correlates well with experimental evidence that this conserved glutamate residue regulates the CLC 'fast' gate in CLC-2 [73,74]. These observed gating motions are consistent with data in the literature. This high-resolution structural model of CLC-2 gating will facilitate experimental design and analysis of future mechanistic studies involving CLC channels.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3013783484"},"_input_hash":-1853129244,"_task_hash":735404986,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734039874,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}
{"text":"Ion channel 'gating' involves the conformational rearrangement of the protein, such that transmembrane ion flow through the channel pore is either increased or decreased. These gates are highly regulated so as to avoid dissipation of cellular ion gradients. CLC channels have two types of gating mechanisms, known as slow and fast gating. Slow gating (also known as 'common gating') involves activation of both subunits of the homodimer in unison, requiring global conformational changes and communication between subunits at the dimer interface [12,75-77]. Fast gating (also known as 'pore gating') acts on each subunit independently and involves much smaller conformational changes, perhaps limited to motions of side chains within the selectivity filter (SF) [8,9,78].

More broadly, these results are in line with recent work that argues that voters may be more strategic (and less behavioral) than is commonly assumed (Ashworth, De Mesquita and Friedenberg, 2018), since they could be reacting to increased campaign spending.

{"text":"We compare high angular resolution mid-infrared (mid-IR) and ALMA far-infrared (far-IR) images of twelve nearby (median 21 Mpc) Seyfert galaxies selected from the Galaxy Activity Torus and Outflow Survey (GATOS). The mid-IR unresolved emission contributes more than 60% of the nuclear (diameters of 1.5 00 GLYPH<24> 150 pc) emission in most galaxies. By contrast, the ALMA 870 GLYPH<22> m continuum emission is mostly resolved with a median diameter of 42 pc and typically along the equatorial direction of the torus (Paper I of the series Garcia-Burillo et al. 2021). The Eddington ratios and nuclear hydrogen column densities ( N H) of half the sample are favorable to launching polar and / or equatorial dusty winds, according to numerical simulations. Six of these show mid-IR extended emission approximately in the polar direction as traced by the narrow line region and perpendicular to the ALMA emission. In a few galaxies, the nuclear N H might be too high to uplift large quantities of dusty material along the polar direction. Five galaxies have low N H and / or Eddington ratios and thus polar dusty winds are not likely. We generate new radiative transfer CAT3D-WIND disk-wind models and model images at 8, 12, and 700 GLYPH<22> m. We tailor these models to the properties of the GATOS Seyferts in this work. At low wind-to-disk cloud ratios the far-IR model images have disk- and ring-like morphologies. The characteristic 'X'-shape associated with dusty winds is seen better in the far-IR at intermediate-high inclinations for the extended-wind configurations. In most of the explored models, the mid-IR emission comes mainly from the inner part of the disk / cone. Extended bi-conical and one-sided polar mid-IR emission is seen in extended-wind configurations and high wind-to-disk cloud ratios. When convolved to the typical angular resolution of our observations, the CAT3D-WIND model images reproduce qualitative aspects of the observed mid- and far-IR morphologies. However, low to intermediate values of the wind-to-disk ratio are required to account for the observed large fractions of unresolved mid-IR emission in our sample. This work and Paper I provide observational support for the torus + wind scenario. The wind component is more relevant at high Eddington ratios and / or AGN luminosities, and polar dust emission is predicted at nuclear column densities of up to GLYPH<24> 10 24 cm GLYPH<0> 2 . The torus / disk component, on the other hand, prevails at low luminosities and / or Eddington ratios.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3178821884"},"_input_hash":2140412495,"_task_hash":233998588,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734039923,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"In parallel with the new observational constraints on the torus properties, theoretical models are continuously evolving. In the first static models the dust was homogeneously distributed (Pier & Krolik 1992a; Granato & Danese 1994; Efstathiou & Rowan-Robinson 1995; Fritz et al. 2006). Subsequently, the dust was distributed in clouds in the so-called clumpy torus models (Nenkova et al. 2008a,b; Schartmann et al. 2008; H\u00f6nig & Kishimoto 2010) and in two phases (Stalevski et al. 2012; Siebenmorgen et al. 2015). Torus models also incorporated an additional polar dust component to account for the mid-IR imaging and interferometric observations of some Seyfert galaxies (Efstathiou et al. 1995; Gallagher et al. 2015; H\u00f6nig & Kishimoto 2017; Stalevski et al. 2017; Isbell et al. 2021).

(2020) demonstrated theoretically that dusty winds can be launched at the inner walls of the torus.

The scaling level (that is, 100%, 90%, etc. at the peak of the galaxy emission) is visually assessed from the PSF-subtracted image and the azimuthally averaged one-dimension (1D) emission profiles (see, e.g., figures 1 in Radomski et al. 2003; Ramos Almeida et al. 2011).

{"text":"Current 3D object detection methods are heavily influenced by 2D detectors. In order to leverage architectures in 2D detectors, they often convert 3D point clouds to regular grids (i.e., to voxel grids or to bird's eye view images), or rely on detection in 2D images to propose 3D boxes. Few works have attempted to directly detect objects in point clouds. In this work, we return to first principles to construct a 3D detection pipeline for point cloud data and as generic as possible. However, due to the sparse nature of the data - samples from 2D manifolds in 3D space - we face a major challenge when directly predicting bounding box parameters from scene points: a 3D object centroid can be far from any surface point thus hard to regress accurately in one step. To address the challenge, we propose VoteNet, an end-to-end 3D object detection network based on a synergy of deep point set networks and Hough voting. Our model achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection on two large datasets of real 3D scans, ScanNet and SUN RGB-D with a simple design, compact model size and high efficiency. Remarkably, VoteNet outperforms previous methods by using purely geometric information without relying on color images.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W2988715931"},"_input_hash":-636453455,"_task_hash":1474079549,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734039972,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

However, few methods studied how to directly propose and detect 3D objects in raw point cloud representation.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W2988715931"},"_input_hash":1445186751,"_task_hash":-699750990,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734039986,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}
{"text":"A traditional Hough voting 2D detector [24] comprises an offline and an online step. First, given a collection of images with annotated object bounding boxes, a codebook is constructed with stored mappings between image patches (or their features) and their offsets to the corresponding object centers. At inference time, interest points are selected from the image to extract patches around them. These patches are then compared against patches in the codebook to retrieve offsets and compute votes. As object patches will tend to vote in agreement, clusters will form near object centers. Finally, the object boundaries are retrieved by tracing cluster votes back to their generating patches.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W2988715931"},"_input_hash":-1739339821,"_task_hash":-1154209179,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734039986,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"We present a novel, end-to-end learnable, multiview 3D point cloud registration algorithm. Registration of multiple scans typically follows a two-stage pipeline: the initial pairwise alignment and the globally consistent refinement. The former is often ambiguous due to the low overlap of neighboring point clouds, symmetries and repetitive scene parts. Therefore, the latter global refinement aims at establishing the cyclic consistency across multiple scans and helps in resolving the ambiguous cases. In this paper we propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first end-to-end algorithm for joint learning of both parts of this two-stage problem. Experimental evaluation on well accepted benchmark datasets shows that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art by a significant margin, while being end-toend trainable and computationally less costly.

{"text":"Downstream tasks in 3D computer vision, such as semantic segmentation and object detection typically require a holistic representation of the scene. The capability of aligning and fusing individual point cloud fragments, which cover only small parts of the environment, into a globally consistent holistic representation is therefore essential and has several use cases in augmented reality and robotics. Pairwise registration of adjacent fragments is a well studied problem and traditional approaches based on geometric constraints [52, 69, 58] and hand-engineered feature descriptors [38, 27, 56, 61] have shown successful results to some extent. Nevertheless, in the recent years, research on local descriptors for pairwise registration of 3D point clouds is centered on deep learning approaches [70, 39, 21, 67, 19, 28] that succeed in capturing and encoding evidence hidden to hand-engineered descriptors.

{"text":"recently proposed [65, 43]. While demonstrating good performance for many tasks, pairwise registration of individual views of a scene has some conceptual drawbacks: (i) low overlap of adjacent point clouds can lead to inaccurate or wrong matches, (ii) point cloud registration has to rely on very local evidence, which can be harmful if 3D scene structure is scarce or repetitive, (iii) separate post-processing is required to combine all pair-wise matches into a global representation. Compared to the pairwise methods, globally consistent multiview alignment of unorganized point cloud fragments is yet to fully benefit from the recent advances achieved by the deep learning methods. State-of-the art methods typically still rely on a good initialization of the pairwise maps, which they try to refine globally in a subsequent decoupled step [30, 63, 2, 3, 5, 4, 44, 11].

The first family of methods employ a multiview ICP-like scheme to optimize for camera poses as well as 3D point correspondences [37, 25, 46, 9]. A majority of these suffer from increased complexity of correspondence estimation. To alleviate this, some approaches only optimize for motion and use the scans to evaluate the registration error [72, 58, 7]. Taking a step further, other modern methods make use of the global cycle-consistency and optimize only over the poses starting from an initial set of pairwise maps. This efficient approach is known as synchronization [10, 63, 2, 58, 3, 5, 44, 72, 7, 36].

For each monitor and each day, we assessed exposure to upwind preproduction wells and total oil and gas production volume within 10 km.

{"text":"Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is a highly morbid condition characterized by inadequate bowel length or capacity to absorb sufficient nutrients or fluids. The most common cause of SBS is bowel resection; however, in children, SBS is often due to congenital anomalies such as atresia, necrotizing enterocolitis, gastroschisis, and volvulus [1].

The phenotypic heterogeneity of pathogenic mutations in both genes is striking. De novo truncating mutations in KAT6B cause a spectrum of disorders, including Genitopatellar syndrome (MIM #606170), Ohdo syndrome (Say-Barber-Biesecker-Young-Simpson SBBYS variant MIM #603736) and a Noonan syndrome-like disorder 10-12 .

{"text":"Abstract. This paper introduces WAM-Studio , an online Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) for recording, mixing, producing, and playing multitrack music. WAM-Studio advances music development by proposing a web-based environment based on a visual programming paradigm of end-user programming (EUP). In this paper, we describe how users can associate individual tracks with real-time audio processing plugins that can then be customized to produce a desired audio effect. Moreover, we describe how users can visually create macros to control multiple plugin parameters at once. While programming macro controls and customizing track parameters might have many applications in the music industry, they also present an opportunity to afford Hard-of-Hearing users greater control over their music listening. To illustrate the potential of WAMStudio, we present a case study illustrating how this tool could be used by Hard-of-Hearing users to modify individual musical elements in a multitrack listening context to create a more enjoyable listening experience.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4386128506"},"_input_hash":-384862330,"_task_hash":-928244026,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734040234,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"A DAW is a feature-rich software, resulting in a notably high complexity of use. It allows musicians to create multi-track songs by: (1) using audio samples directly (e.g., by incorporating an audio file into a track or recording from a microphone or sound card input), (2) synthesizing audio using virtual instruments (e.g., a software recreation of a piano), (3) mixing various audio tracks together, and (4) applying sound effects to each track (e.g., reverb, frequency equalization, or auto-tune on vocals).","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4386128506"},"_input_hash":1815523734,"_task_hash":1231898190,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734040236,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

The first online DAWs appeared in 2008, using Flash technology, while the first DAWs using HTML5 and the Web Audio API for audio processing only appeared between 2015 and 2016 [3]. Online DAWs present distinct advantages over conventional DAWs such as lower barriers to entry and the ability to easily share and access projects from any device with an internet connection. A large variety of audio plugins (a kind of software module) extends the functionality of DAWs, offering users greater flexibility and control over their music production [2]. Since 1997, a significant market has developed for thirdparty plugin developers offering thousands of plugins that are compatible with all major DAWs.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4386128506"},"_input_hash":163407374,"_task_hash":1083360752,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734040236,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"Previous work has illustrated the similarities between end-user programming (EUP) tools and music composition tools such as DAWs [6, 11, 15]. EUP aims to solve the mismatch between end users' high expectations and specific domain knowledge but limited programming expertise [14]. Current practice shows that computer musicians become a kind of end-user programmer who face challenges that are similar to their professional counterparts in software engineering [8, 12]. The difference is that DAWs aim to enable end users (musicians) to design, tailor, and customize audio. We suggest that some of the difficulties might be a result of the choice of programming paradigm. The user's ability to negotiate the constraints of the tool and assimilate its particular language is crucial in either case, whether engaging with visual metaphors or learning system-specific languages to build highly determined musical processes.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4386128506"},"_input_hash":1052012594,"_task_hash":-1127038288,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734040237,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

Detection of the signal's support from data corrupted by noise is still a challenging problem, especially if the level of noise must be estimated.

We introduce the Noise Collector (NC) matrix C and solve an augmented system A \u03c1 + C \u03b7 = b 0 + e , where e is the noise. We show that the l 1 -norm minimal solution of the augmented system has zero false discovery rate for any level of noise and with probability that tends to one as the dimension of b 0 increases to infinity. We also obtain exact support recovery if the noise is not too large, and develop a Fast Noise Collector Algorithm which makes the computational cost of solving the augmented system comparable to that of the original one.

If we can more closely match the operation of zonelevel building controls-heating, ventilation, and air conditioning  (HVAC)  and  lighting-with  occupants'  utilization of space, we can reduce the amount of time spaces are conditioned or lighted unnecessarily. Modern HVAC and lighting systems are moving toward more real-time control, and new research is focusing on human-in-theloop control of building systems [3]. However, two open questions remain: (1) How can we leverage new datastreams in buildings to infer true occupancy patterns?; (2) Can we recommend new layouts in those buildings that take advantage of such highly controllable building systems, thereby improving energy efficiency?

The number of clusters can be naturally defined as the number of available zones in the building. Assuming the building is fully occupied, the size of the clusters can also be defined as the number of occupants per zone. Traditional clustering techniques allow for the specification of the number of clusters, but specification of the cluster sizes is rare. We therefore take a hierarchical clustering approach that allows for user determination of the exact clusters based on a dendrogram. We employ an agglomerative approach, in which each occupant starts in their own cluster, and clusters are joined based on the distances between occupants' activity vectors. We define the distance between two activity vectors as the Euclidean distance, and we utilize the complete linkage criterion to agglomerate clusters.

{"text":"Increasing evidence has implicated the role of the GH/IGF system in human reproductive physiology [1, 2]. Growth hormone modulates gonadotropin secretion and regulates longitudinal growth and function of secondary sexual organs, including activation of the formation of uterus in females and prostate and seminal vesicles in males [2]. Exogenous GH administration has been suggested as a potential treatment option for male infertility by increasing sperm count and total motile spermatozoa in infertile idiopathic oligozoospermic (OZ) men [3], improving sperm motility in asthenozoospermic (AZ) and OZ men [4, 5], and might even induce pregnancies in AZ men [6]. Although GH promotes the secretion of IGF-I and IGF-II mainly from the liver [7], localized testicular and prostatic production of these peptides are independent of GH induction [8] and can act in an autocrine/paracrine fashion [9].

{"text":"Coaching, which involves classroom observation and expert feedback, is a widespread and fundamental part of teacher training. However, the majority of teachers do not have access to consistent, high quality coaching due to limited resources and access to expertise. We explore whether generative AI could become a costeffective complement to expert feedback by serving as an automated teacher coach. In doing so, we propose three teacher coaching tasks for generative AI: (A) scoring transcript segments based on classroom observation instruments, (B) identifying highlights and missed opportunities for good instructional strategies, and (C) providing actionable suggestions for eliciting more student reasoning. We recruit expert math teachers to evaluate the zero-shot performance of ChatGPT on each of these tasks for elementary math classroom transcripts. Our results reveal that ChatGPT generates responses that are relevant to improving instruction, but they are often not novel or insightful. For example, 82 %of the model's suggestions point to places in the transcript where the teacher is already implementing that suggestion. Our work highlights the challenges of producing insightful, novel and truthful feedback for teachers while paving the way for future research to address these obstacles and improve the capacity of generative AI to coach teachers. 1","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4385565029"},"_input_hash":-1389219427,"_task_hash":1141244796,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734040338,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

We want to stress that even though CacheGen is compared head-to-head with these methods, it makes no assumption about the context and the model, so one can combine CacheGen with these methods to potentially further improve the performance.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4401176373"},"_input_hash":717701607,"_task_hash":102310069,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734040466,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"The methods used to represent OOV words can impact the geometry of their representations. For example, the representation of OOV words often have smaller norms ( L 2 of the word embedding) than in-vocabulary words. This is because a common way to represent OOV words is to take the average of their subwords (Pilehvar and CamachoCollados, 2019; Blevins and Zettlemoyer, 2020; Bommasani et al., 2020). However, since the average values for each dimension are near zero, the more subwords that are averaged, the smaller the norm of the vectors (Adi et al., 2017) (figure 1). As a result, the Pearson's correlation between the norm and number of subwords is r = -0 . 92 . A common alternative to averaging subwords is to use the first subword to represent an OOV word. When this representation is used, the correlation between the norm and the number of subwords reverses and is slightly positive, Pearson's r = 0 . 22 (figure 4 in Appendix). One possible explanation could be that the first subword of OOV words are more likely to be stop words, which are known to have larger norms (Ethayarajh, 2019). The difference in geometry between OOV and in-vocabulary words exists in both representation methods. This could could result in impacts on tasks using embeddingbased retrieval (e.g., nearest-neighbor LM) as lowfrequency names will have additionally distinguishing geometric characteristics as a result of tokenization.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4280645526"},"_input_hash":-825800065,"_task_hash":-488220498,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734040498,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

After, as compared to before, seeing the plays, people reported greater empathy for groups depicted in the shows, held opinions that were more consistent with socio-political issues highlighted in the shows, and donated more money to charities related to the shows. Seeing theatre also led participants to donate more to charities unrelated to the shows, suggesting that theatre\u00d5s effects on pro-sociality generalize to different contexts.

{"text":"In this paper, we present a parallel implementation of the black-box method in [18, 9] for evaluating Eq. (1) using O ( N ) memory and computation. The key idea is using Lagrange interpolation to construct approximations of the kernel function K ( x , y ) when x and y are distant. Unlike fast algorithms that have been developed for specific kernel functions, our method applies to a wide range of functions. Successful stories include applications of our method in dislocation dynamics simulations [9] and aquifer characterization [23]. In those two applications, no fast algorithm exists for the two kernel functions-the Green's function in anisotropic elasticity and the isotropic exponential function. In particular, our method requires only a black-box routine to evaluate the kernel function, and thus can be integrated easily with other codes. For example, our package was used in an iso-geometric boundary element method to obtain a solver of O ( N ) complexity [7]. Other examples of using (an earlier version of) our code are in the elastic formulation of the displacement discontinuity method for the simulation of micro-seismicity [24, 25, 26]. Extension of our algorithm for solving/factorizing kernel matrices has been explored in [27, 28].","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3025420576"},"_input_hash":533445099,"_task_hash":-2035920955,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734040572,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}
{"text":"To evaluate Eq. (1), our method follows the general FMM machinery as follows. First, the problem domain containing { x i } N i =1 and { y i } N i =1 is partitioned in a hierarchical fashion (see Fig. 1(a)), and the partitioning is associated with a tree data structure where every tree node represents a subdomain in the hierarchy. Second, a post-order traversal of the tree is performed, and the 'multipole coefficients' associated with every tree node is computed as a compact representation of the source points and corresponding weights that the subdomain contains. This step is often called an upward pass. Third, at every level of the hierarchy, the 'local coefficients' of every tree node is computed using the 'multipole coefficients' of its interaction list (two nodes are in each other's interaction list if their parents are adjacent but they are not; see Fig. 1(b)). Fourth, a pre-order traversal of the tree is performed to 'accumulate' the local coefficients of all nodes to those at the leaf level. This step is often called a downward pass.

{"text":"where k > 0 is real and T is large. The problem of understanding the behavior of these moments is central in the theory of the Riemann zeta-function. The classical work of Hardy and Littlewood [6], and Ingham [8] established asymptotic formulae for I k ( T ) in the cases k = 1 and 2, and these still remain the only situations where an asymptotic is known. Lacking an asymptotic, much work has been focussed on the problems of obtaining sharp upper and lower bounds for these moments. Lower bounds of the form I k ( T ) /greatermuch k T (log T ) k 2 are established for all k /greaterorequalslant 1 in Radziwi/suppressl/suppressl and Soundararajan [9] unconditionally, and for all k /greaterorequalslant 0 conditionally on the Riemann Hypothesis in papers of Heath-Brown and Ramachandra, see [11, 12, 5]. Upper bounds of the form I k ( T ) /lessmuch k T (log T ) k 2 are known when k = 1 /n for natural numbers n (due to Heath-Brown [5]) and when k = 1 + 1 /n for natural numbers n (by work of Bettin, Chandee, and Radziwi/suppressl/suppressl [2]).

{"text":"Electrochemical ion insertion involves coupled ion-electron transfer reactions, transport of guest species,  and redox of the host. The hosts  are typically anisotropic solids with two-dimensional conduction planes, but can also be materials with one-dimensional or isotropic transport pathways. These insertion compounds have traditionally been studied in the context of energy storage, but also find extensive applications in electrocatalysis, optoelectronics, and computing. Recent developments in operando, ultrafast, and high-resolution characterization methods, as well as accurate theoretical simulation methods, have led to a renaissance in the understanding of ion-insertion compounds. In this Review, we present a unified framework for understanding insertion compounds across time and length scales ranging from atomic to device levels. Using graphite, transition metal dichalcogenides, layered oxides, oxyhydroxides, and olivines as examples, we explore commonalities in these materials in terms of point defects, interfacial reactions, and phase transformations. We illustrate similarities in  the  operating  principles  of  various  ion-insertion  devices  ranging  from  batteries  and electrocatalysts to electrochromics and thermal transistors, with the goal of unifying research across disciplinary boundaries.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3164284701"},"_input_hash":1244019104,"_task_hash":-878753972,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734040615,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}
{"text":"To many, electrochemical ion-insertion  solids are synonymous with Li-ion battery electrodes 1 . Indeed, materials that accommodate the insertion and removal of Li into and out of their structure through coupled ion/electron transfer redox reactions have found their most prevalent application in powering mobile electronic devices; widespread adoption of electric vehicles and the use of batteries to decarbonize the electric grid are also becoming realities. John Goodenough, Stanley Whittingham, and Akira Yoshino were awarded  the  2019  Nobel  Prize  in  Chemistry  for  their  seminal  work  on  developing  this  ubiquitous technology 2 . The story of electrochemical ion insertion materials, however, extends well beyond batteries. Early work carried out during the chimie douce , or 'soft chemistry,' movement of the 1980's and 90's established electrochemical ion insertion as a synthetic strategy to change the chemical composition of a host material through  the  addition of guest species into the interstitial sites of the  stable host crystal structure 3-6 . Today, ion insertion plays a central role in numerous applications beyond batteries, such as electrocatalysis,  electrochromics,  thermal  switching,  separations,  desalination,  and  neuromorphic transistors ( Figure 1 ). Although these devices operate across a broad range of length and time scales, they share the same basic working principle: an applied electrical potential inserts ions into (or removes ions from) a host material, altering its local chemical, electronic, and lattice structure and modulating its optical, electronic, and thermal properties.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3164284701"},"_input_hash":1617303153,"_task_hash":-2144177052,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734040615,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}
{"text":"A typical ion-insertion device consists of two mixed ion-electron-conducting electrodes separated by an ion-conducting electrolyte. Ion insertion is driven by a gradient in the electrochemical potential of the ions being inserted, and is accompanied by a second, charge-compensating carrier entering the same material 7 . An applied external voltage/current enables precise control over the number of ions being inserted into the host material. Although ion insertion is conceptually simple, its underlying microscopic details are complex and not completely understood. At least three main processes are involved: the desolvation of the ion in the electrolyte (most well studied for liquid electrolytes), the interfacial transport of the ion from the electrolyte into the host lattice, and the transfer of an electron from the host lattice i.e. redox. For bulk insertion to occur, both an electron and an unoccupied site at the surface of the host lattice must be available. Once the ion has entered the host lattice from the electrolyte, it maintains its charge, while the electron is transferred to the host lattice, where it may become localized 8 . Thus, migration of the ion occurs via the ambipolar hopping of an ion-electron pair.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3164284701"},"_input_hash":963661345,"_task_hash":-1353586197,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734040616,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"In contrast to the field effect, ion insertion involves a different approach to tuning material properties. First, the concentration of inserted ions is not fixed, but is dynamically variable. Furthermore, the composition can be actively tuned over a very wide range, from a fraction of a percent up to one or more guest atoms per unit cell. This leads to a second important consequence, that the effects of insertion can no longer be considered in terms of a dilute and continuum picture. Strong local modifications occur in the bonding configuration and electronic structure of the host. Third, interactions between different species, such as between the inserted ion and host atoms or between the inserted ions themselves, result in higher order atomic structures that determine various parameters such as the activation energy for ionic transport. An essential consequence of all the above features is that ion insertion is a nonlinear phenomenon with respect to ion concentration: the large concentration of guest species, and their mutual interactions, causes intrinsic properties such as ionic mobility and point defect formation energy to become composition dependent.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3164284701"},"_input_hash":-14915218,"_task_hash":-67603631,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734040617,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}
{"text":"In this Review, we briefly summarize the basic materials science principles behind this class of materials and demonstrate how electrochemical ion insertion can be used to tune material properties towards a wide variety of applications from mature technologies such as batteries and electrochromics to emerging ones in electrocatalysis, thermal regulation, neuromorphic computing, and water purification. The unique aspect of ion insertion that enables tuning of physical (optical, electronic, thermal etc.) and chemical properties is the simultaneous modulation of the host material's atomic and electronic structures, through the insertion of both ions and compensating electrons. Note that we do not focus on the pseudo-capacitance of fast-charging porous electrodes, which sometimes include ion-insertion nanoparticles, since this phenomenon has been recently reviewed in a broader context 10 .  While the fundamental concepts discussed below are largely focused on crystalline inorganic materials, some of these ideas may apply more broadly to other mixed ionelectron conductors. These include amorphous organic materials like polymers 11 , and crystalline organicinorganic materials like hybrid perovskites 12 .  For a pedagogical introduction to some of the concepts discussed here, the readers are suggested to review relevant textbooks 7,9,13-16 . It is not our goal to provide a thorough technological review of the  various  ion insertion applications,  but rather to demonstrate the fundamental principles behind their operation. In doing so, we hope to unite the efforts of these different fields  and  present a  framework for understanding electrochemical ion insertion across time and length scales ranging from the atomic to device level.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3164284701"},"_input_hash":1047282000,"_task_hash":-764346204,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734040618,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"Ecological selection is a major driver of community assembly. Selection is classified as stabilizing when species with intermediate trait values gain the highest reproductive success, whereas selection is considered directional when fitness is highest for species with extreme trait values. Previous studies have investigated the effects of different selection types on trait distribution, but the effects of selection on species diversity have remained unclear. Here, we propose a framework for inferring the type and strength of selection by studying species diversity and trait distribution together against null expectations. We use a simulation model to confirm our prediction that directional selection should lead to lower species diversity than stabilizing selection despite a similar effect on trait community-weighted variance. We apply the framework to a mesocosm system of annual plants to test whether differences in species diversity between two habitats that vary in productivity are related to differences in selection on seed mass. We show that, in both habitats, species diversity was lower than the null expectation, but that species diversity was lower in the more productive habitat. We attribute this difference to strong directional selection for large-seeded species in the productive habitat as indicated by trait community-weighted-mean being higher and community-weighted variance being lower than the null expectations. In the less productive habitat, we found that community-weighted variance was higher than expected by chance, suggesting that seed mass could be a driver of niche partitioning under such conditions. Altogether, our results suggest that viewing species diversity and trait distribution as interrelated patterns driven by the same process, ecological selection, is helpful in understanding community assembly.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3205417062"},"_input_hash":-1860138238,"_task_hash":324119112,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734040712,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"For thousands of years, the unique physicochemical properties of plant exudates have defined uses in material culture and practical applications. Native Australian plant exudates, including resins, kinos, and gums, have been used and continue to be used by Aboriginal Australians for numerous technical and cultural purposes. A historic collection of well-preserved native Australian plant exudates, assembled a century ago by plant naturalists, gives a rare window into the history and chemical composition of these materials. Here we report the full hierarchical characterization of four genera from this  collection, Xanthorrhoea , Callitris , Eucalyptus ,  and Acacia ,  from  the  local  elemental speciation, to functional groups and main molecular markers. We use high-resolution X-ray Raman spectroscopy (XRS) to achieve bulk-sensitive chemical speciation of these plant exudates, including insoluble, amorphous, and cross-linked fractions, without the limitation of invasive and/or surface specific methods. Combinatorial testing of the XRS data allows direct classification of these complex natural species as terpenoid, aromatic,  phenolic,  and  polysaccharide  materials.  Differences  in  intragenera  chemistry was evidenced by detailed interpretation of the XRS spectral features. We complement XRS with Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS), and pyrolysis-GC-MS (Py-GC-MS). This multimodal approach provides a fundamental understanding of the chemistry of these natural materials long used by Aboriginal Australian peoples.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4281556450"},"_input_hash":-1555314123,"_task_hash":-173484058,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734040728,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

Kino composition is based on the presence of hydrolyzable tannins (gallic acid and sugars) and condensed tannins (poly hydroxyflavan-3-ols)  which  creates  the  significant  tannin  composition  of  the  kino,  and  it  is  at  the  base  of  its  characteristic astringent properties (33). The  two Eucalyptus kinos analyzed in this study presented quite different compositions. White mallee is mainly  constituted  by  hydrolyzable  tannins,  with  a  relatively  low content of sugars. E. largiflorens comprises relatively high amounts of  both  hydrolyzable  tannins  (with  a  higher  sugar  content)  and condensed  tannins.

{"text":"Acacia exhibit  characteristic  features  of  polysaccharides;  thus, they belong to the wide category of gums. As such, they are watersoluble  materials  that  contain  polysaccharide-protein  complexes and are biopolymers which can act as emulsifiers that occur in a range  of  colors  (74).  Stretching  back  70,000  y  ago,  Acacia has found  many  applications  in  arts,  cosmetics,  medicines,  and  food and  continues  to  be  a  significantly  traded  commodity  worldwide (74).  Aboriginal  Australian  peoples  use  acacia  (wattle  gum)  in  a variety of food preparations, either by mixing the gum in water or mixing with other native foods such as eugenia apples, as well as in  medicinal  preparations  for  treating  colds  and  coughs  (11,  7577).  In  arts,  Acacia gums  are  found  as  binders  across  several cultures for various painting and ink media (e.g., watercolors and gouache)  (74,  78,  79).  Gum  Arabic,  one  of  the  most  notable  gums historically  used  as  binding  media  in  artworks  across  Africa,  the Mediterranean region, and Asia, derives from A. senegal and Acacia seyal (recently named genera Senegalia and Vachellia, respectively), and  it  is  harvested  commercially  mainly  in  Sudan  (80%)  (1).

{"text":"Cultural heritage conservators often face the challenge of treating an object while respecting the artistic intent and cultural fac- tors, thus avoiding interventions with modern synthetic materials where possible (81). The accurate characterization and under- standing of the natural binders' chemical and physical properties and stability are important for the treatment decisions as well as understanding the intent of the artist. There is extensive literature on the analysis of  European  artists'  binder  materials  across  several  categories including resins, polysaccharides, terpenoids, waxes, and oils (10); however,  the  characterization  of  native  Australian  materials  is significantly  understudied  as  compared  to  European materials.  In addition,  there  are  not  complete  or  comprehensive  datasets  for Australian raw materials, as there are for European, Asian, African, and  North  and  South  American  materials  [see,  for  instance,  the Infrared  and  Raman  Users  Group  database  (82)].

{"text":"In ethnolinguistically diverse societies, disadvantaged groups often face immense pressure to  acquire  and  speak  the  language  of  the  advantaged  group  to  achieve  social  inclusion  and economic mobility. This work investigates the impact on disadvantaged group members' ingroup pride  and  self-esteem  when  they  use  the  language  of  the  advantaged  group  and  their  native language. We test two competing hypotheses: disadvantaged group members experience higher ingroup  pride  when  using  their  native  language  due  to  its  emotional  significance  (Nativity Hypothesis) or when using the language of the advantaged group due to its potential to activate subordination-dominance relations (Insecurity Hypothesis). In six experimental studies conducted among Palestinian citizens of Israel (total N = 1,348), respondents reported significantly higher ingroup pride when answering a survey in Hebrew compared to Arabic, supporting the Insecurity Hypothesis. Studies 2a-2b reported higher ingroup pride in Hebrew, regardless of the identity of the audience (ingroup vs. outgroup researcher). Study 3 replicated this result in a setting featuring the  'bogus-pipeline'  technique,  suggesting   that  the  language  effect  was  not  driven  by  social desirability. Finally, Study 4 examined other self-conscious constructs to validate insecurity as a potential mechanism and demonstrated that participants engaged in compensation by enhancing their collective self-esteem and attaching more positive attributes to their group in Hebrew than Arabic. These findings combinedly suggest that the disadvantaged group members' perceptions of themselves are constructed through languages that symbolize varied statuses within the hierarchy, and highlight the importance of recognizing power relations within multilingualism contexts.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4376255784"},"_input_hash":116507008,"_task_hash":1580152190,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734040777,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}
{"text":"The ability to speak multiple languages is often considered a valuable asset, especially among  disadvantaged  minority  populations,  as  it  can  open  doors  to  enhanced  educational, professional,  and  economic  opportunities,  facilitate  their  integration  in  the  wider  society,  and encourage  intergroup  communication  (Furstenau,  2000;  Skutnabb-Kangas,  2000).  However, language is not merely a means of communication; it can be an indicator of culture, national or ethnic identity, and status (Giles et al., 1977; Pinker, 2007; Suleiman, 2004). In intergroup settings where disadvantaged and advantaged groups are identified with different languages, language not only can be implicated in the conflict but also intertwine with people's perceptions of their own identities (Pavlenko & Blackledge, 2004). For instance, Arabic and Hebrew in Israel/Palestine and Aboriginal languages and English in Canada, lie at the heart of group identities and reflect the dynamics of intergroup relations (Amara, 2018; Droogendyk & Wright, 2017). In these contexts, the  native  language  of  the  disadvantaged  group  and  the  societally  dominant  language  of  the advantaged group are likely to create different frames of mind for speakers who shift between these languages (see Pavlenko, 2006).","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4376255784"},"_input_hash":-1461948223,"_task_hash":-42881327,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734040778,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}
{"text":"Given that language is a marker of identity, and it has been shown to impact both emotion and cognition (Barrett et al., 2007; Cimpian et al., 2007; Idan et al., 2018; Lindquist & Gendron, 2013; Wakslak et al., 2014), we argue that disadvantaged group members' feelings about their identity and group membership are shaped by the language they use. Specifically, the objective of this  research is to discern how the use of a societally dominant language versus a subordinate language influences disadvantaged group members' pride and collective self-esteem. Integrating social, psychological, and linguistics research, two competing hypotheses are tested to ascertain whether the dominant language or the subordinate native language would elicit higher feelings of ingroup pride among disadvantaged group members.

This paper shows that some equations regarding the centroid shift of the bunch, the peak position of the bunch profile, bunch length, and extraction of impedance from the bunch profile can be derived from the Haissinski equation in a self-consistent manner. In particular, a generalized quadratic equation for potential-well bunch lengthening is obtained to accommodate any absolute impedance model, expanding upon Zotter's cubic equation, which is primarily applicable to inductive impedance. The equations derived in this paper are tested using computed impedance models for some electron storage rings, showing machine-dependent properties of impedance effects.

{"text":"Modern particle accelerators are designed to deliver high-intensity and high-brightness charged beams for experiments in a wide range of fields, from high-energy particle physics to material science. Interactions between charged beams and their surroundings, mediated by beam-induced electromagnetic fields and commonly described by the concepts of wakefield and its Fourier transform impedance [1, 2], play a crucial role in limiting beam quality. Throughout the entire life cycle of an accelerator project, it is imperative to thoroughly investigate the collective effects driven by impedance. Typically, impedance budgets are created during the design phase to predict impedance-driven beam phenomena reliably.

However, Zotter's equation is not self-consistent and is valid only when a pure inductance (i.e. purely imaginary impedance) can approximate the longitudinal total impedance of the ring. For a review of Zotter's equation and its validity, see [7]. When applied to a real machine, the equation itself might introduce uncertainties and contribute to the discrepancy between simulations and experiments, in addition to other factors reviewed in [4, 5]. On the other hand, the Haissinski equation [8] is a stationary self-consistent solution of the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck (VFP) equation [9] with an absolute impedance model below the threshold current of microwave instability (MWI, see Sec. 2.4.10 of [10] for further details). In principle, it is more appropriate to compare the solutions of the Haissinski equation below the MWI threshold current or the VFP equation at higher currents with experimental results when studying the longitudinal impedance effects. However, certain efforts must be made to solve these nonlinear equations (for example, see [11, 12] for numerical techniques to solve these equations). To reduce such efforts, this paper presents several handy equations derived from the Haissinski equation to facilitate the calculationexperiment connections with their applications to real machines.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4392650084"},"_input_hash":1492707134,"_task_hash":-1954408778,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734040817,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

When the oscillations are of small amplitude, the motion of the electrons is linear. In the presence of radiation damping and quantum excitation, the beam reaches a stable equilibrium distribution in the longitudinal phase space, which is Gaussian [13].

The results are compared with the centroid shift and the peak shift using Vlasov simulations with the impedance model, as shown in Fig. 13. The three measurements displayed good general reproducibility of the current-dependent beam phase, albeit with some data scattering, potentially arising from machine conditions or experimental setup specifics. As the measurements did not provide absolute beam phases, the peak positions in the simulations were adjusted by -0.5 degrees, revealing a relatively good alignment with the measurements. This suggests that the impedance model predicts the measured behavior well. However, a notable discrepancy in centroid shift was observed, particularly at lower bunch currents. Although we could simply adjust the simulated centroid shifts at low currents to match the measurements, disagreement at high bunch currents will indicate a significant lack of resistance in the impedance model. Intuitively speaking, if the BPM signal is roughly proportional to d\u03bb h ( z ) /dz , as seen from Fig. 10 of [18], measuring the zero-crossing point is essentially measuring the peak position of the bunch profile, but not the center of mass. The principle is illustrated in Fig. 14. However, this correlation requires validation through a detailed simulation of the BPM signal, involving accurate modeling of both the button electrodes of the BPM and the long coaxial cable connecting the BPM to the oscilloscope.

We  constructed  a  mathematical  framework,  modeling  the dynamics of the host-microbiome ecosystem in response to alterations. We find that when this ecosystem  is  exposed  to  substantial  perturbations,  the  microbiome  may  shift  towards  a composition that reinforces the new host state. Such positive feedback loop augments postperturbation imbalances, hindering attempts to return to the initial equilibrium, thus promoting relapse episodes and prolonged addictions. We also find that the initial microbiome composition is  a  key  factor:  a  diverse  microbiome  enhances  the  ecosystem's  resilience,  whereas  lower microbiome diversity is more prone to reach dysbiosis, exacerbating addictions. This framework provides novel evolutionary and ecological perspectives on host-microbiome interactions and their  implications  for  host  behavior  and  health,  while  offering  verifiable  predictions  with potential relevance to clinical treatments.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4289816757"},"_input_hash":26934911,"_task_hash":1169125155,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734040855,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"Abstract -Probabilistic generative models are attractive for scientific modeling because their inferred parameters can be used to generate hypotheses and design experiments. This requires that the learned model provides an accurate representation of the input data and yields a latent space that effectively predicts outcomes relevant to the scientific question. Supervised Variational Autoencoders (SVAEs) have previously been used for this purpose, as a carefully designed decoder can be used as an interpretable generative model of the data, while the supervised objective ensures a predictive latent representation. Unfortunately, the supervised objective forces the encoder to learn a biased approximation to the generative posterior distribution, which renders the generative parameters unreliable when used in scientific models. This issue has remained undetected as reconstruction losses commonly used to evaluate model performance do not detect bias in the encoder. We address this previously-unreported issue by developing a second-order supervision framework (SOS-VAE) that updates the decoder parameters, rather than the encoder, to induce a predictive latent representation. This ensures that the encoder maintains a reliable posterior approximation and the decoder parameters can be effectively interpreted. We extend this technique to allow the user to trade-off the bias in the generative parameters for improved predictive performance, acting as an intermediate option between SVAEs and our new SOS-VAE. We also use this methodology to address missing data issues that often arise when combining recordings from multiple scientific experiments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these developments using synthetic data and electrophysiological recordings with an emphasis on how our learned representations can be used to design scientific experiments.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3199353954"},"_input_hash":-1183613994,"_task_hash":496528396,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734040875,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

Obtaining a predictive latent representation allows for researchers to identify patterns relevant to the auxiliary variables and establish causality through experimental modification [13].

However, this bias in the variational objective can have a profoundly negative impact on causal scientific experiments designed using the decoder parameters.

This approach yields a model that possesses both properties required for scientific utility, a predictive latent space and an unbiased posterior approximation. We empirically demonstrate these properties on a real dataset which uses Local Field Potentials (LFPs) recordings [4, 5] to predict a behavioral trait.

Because of this, our SOS framework can cause degraded predictive performance relative to an SVAE when the variational approximation is unconstrained by the generative model. While sometimes this degradation is scientifically necessary and unavoidable, often a faint amount of bias is acceptable to obtain substantial gains in predictive ability. Our first extension provides a means to relax the constraint on the variational encoder, allowing it to maintain high predictive ability with minimal bias in the approximation. Using Kullback-Liebler (KL) divergences [24], we demonstrate on both synthetic and real data examples that this regularization approach improves predictive performance for a given level of posterior discrepancy compared to an SVAE-based model.

Joint modeling, such as probabilistic supervised principal component analysis [25] or supervised Gaussian processes [26], assumes that the observations and the outcome are independent given a latent representation. Once the prior distribution of the latent factors and the conditional distributions have been defined, statistical estimation is straightforward by maximum likelihood or Bayesian methods [27]. However, it has been demonstrated that joint models suffer under model misspecification, particularly when the number of learned factors is less than the true latent dimensionality [23, 28]. Furthermore, the variance of the outcomes is often small relative to the variance of the observations, which leads to the outcome being poorly characterized [9].","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3199353954"},"_input_hash":-235354189,"_task_hash":2007131182,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734040905,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

Using an SAE can be viewed as a form of regularization and prevents the latent representation from over-fitting, which has been shown theoretically to enhance generalizability [19]. It has also been shown in deep learning that adding auxiliary tasks can act as a form of regularization [29, 30, 31].

{"text":"A question of interest in a wide range of problems in economics and operations research is whether the solution to an optimization problem is monotone with respect to its parameters. The analysis of this question is called comparative statics . 1 Following Topkis' seminal work (Topkis, 1978), comparative statics methods have received significant attention in the economics and operations research literature. 2 While comparative statics methods are usually applied to static optimization problems, they can also be applied to dynamic optimization problems. In particular, these methods can be used to study how the policy function 3 changes with respect to the current state of the system or with respect to other parameters of the dynamic optimization problem. 4 That is, for multi-period optimization models, comparative statics methods can be used to determine how the current period's optimal decision changes with respect to the parameters of the optimization problem. For example, in a Markov decision process, under suitable conditions on the payoff function and on the transition function, comparative statics methods can be applied to show that the optimal decision is increasing in the discount factor when the state of the system is fixed. But since the model is dynamic and includes uncertainty, the states' evolution is different under different discount factors, and thus, it is not clear whether the future optimal decision is increasing in the discount factor even when the current optimal decision is increasing in the discount factor for a fixed state.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3126527592"},"_input_hash":-1977344106,"_task_hash":-588916083,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734040929,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"The expected value E t ( g ( e )) is interpreted in two different ways. From a probabilistic point of view, E t ( g ( e )) is the expected optimal decision in period t as a function of the parameters e . For example, in investment theory, this expected value usually represents the expected capital accumulation in the system in period t (Stokey and Lucas, 1989). In inventory management, it represents the expected inventory in period t (Krishnan and Winter, 2010), and in income fluctuation problems it represents the expected wealth accumulation (see Huggett (2004) and Bommier and Grand (2018)) in period t . From a deterministic point of view, if we consider a population of ex-ante identical agents whose states evolve independently according to the stochastic process that governs the states' dynamics, then \u00b5 t represents the empirical distribution of states in period t . In this case, E t ( g ( e )) corresponds to the average decision in period t of this population given the parameters e . This latter interpretation is common in the growing literature on stationary equilibrium models and mean field equilibrium models. In this literature, while the focus is on the analysis of equilibrium, some stochastic comparative statics results have been obtained (see Adlakha and Johari (2013) and Acemoglu and Jensen (2015)). These stochastic comparative statics results are useful in analyzing the equilibrium of these models. In particular, proving comparative statics results and establishing the uniqueness of an equilibrium (see Hopenhayn (1992), Light (2018b), Acemoglu and Jensen (2018), and Light and Weintraub (2019)).","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3126527592"},"_input_hash":1441704877,"_task_hash":-1565997180,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734040933,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

The antegrade repriming with blood under controlled conditions may reduce the presence of gaseous microemboli (GME), which play a primary role in postoperative neurocognitive alterations (15). A major contributor to the embolic load is CPB initiation, through the extrication of certain microemboli that may remain in the oxygenation chamber as a result of an inef /uniFB01 cient priming with crystalloid solution (1,16). During HAR, these microemboli can be displaced by the increase in density caused by the in /uniFB02 ux of blood to the oxygenation chamber (17). Thus, GME can be directed to the collector bag rather than remaining in the circuit as a potential hazard. Therefore, it is likely that HAR achieves a reduction in GME delivery in comparison to crystalloid priming during CPB initiation.

{"text":"With advances in non-myeloablative transplant techniques and supportive care, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) is increasingly offered to older adults with hematologic malignancies in the US, with adults aged 65 and older now accounting for 26% of allogeneic transplant recipients as of 2019. 1,2 While studies suggest well-selected older adults can benefit from alloHCT with good outcomes, 3,4 the morbidity and mortality of alloHCT remain higher for older adults than for their younger counterparts. 5 Geriatric assessments (GA) have been identified as a useful tool for predicting post-alloHCT outcomes. In particular, pre-transplant functional status has been shown to be predictive of transplant outcomes including non-relapse mortality (NRM), overall survival (OS), or progression-free survival (PFS) in older adults. 6-10 Additionally, cognitive impairment was identified as a predictor of higher NRM in a multicenter study. 11 The incorporation of a GA into the standard pre-transplant evaluation may improve our ability to risk-stratify and counsel patients, as well as to allow for planning of better supportive care and risk mitigation for high-risk patients who can benefit from alloHCT but may require additional support. 12","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4214943500"},"_input_hash":-446447,"_task_hash":-1818945309,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734041332,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

Consequently,  whereas  PLA  containing  >  99%  L-lactide  (PLLA) takes  more  than  5  years  to  completely  breakdown  after  implantation  in  animals  and humans, PLA containing > 99% D-lactide (PDLA) takes only 1.5 years 1 .  Furthermore, melt-blending a 50/50 ratio of PLLA and PDLA results in stereocomplex PLA that has higher mechanical strength, melting point and crystallinity, and slower degradation rate than either  homopolymer because of its more compact crystal orientation 3 .  Hydrolytic degradation of PLLA and stereocomplex has been characterized 4 . Degradation products of  PLA,  including  oligomers  and  monomers of lactic acid,  drive adverse  host  immune responses  such  as  long-term  inflammation  and  excessive  fibrosis  which  impair  PLA medical devices from performing their diagnostic, therapeutic or regenerative functions. Historically, adverse responses to PLA degradation have been attributed to the accompanying acidity from breakdown products 5 . Recently, an alternative mechanism for immune cell activation to bulk PLA and its hydrolytic degradation products was proposed using  a  bioenergetic  in-vitro  model  simulating  in-vivo  events 6 .  In  the  study,  altered bioenergetic homeostasis and functional metabolic profiles were discovered to underlie adverse  immune  responses  to  amorphous  and  crystalline  PLA  degradation.  Higher crystallinity delayed onset of adverse immune responses, likely from faster degradation in  amorphous  compared  to  semi  crystalline  PLA 6 .  However,  spanning  over  decades, adverse responses to PLA have been controversial. While there have been some studies showing  only  mild  proinflammatory  responses  to  PLA  degradation  products 7-9 ,  other studies  have  demonstrated  that  PLA  degradation  is  accompanied  by  severe  adverse immune responses 10-14 which could necessitate intervention in patients 15-17 . Differing PLA stereochemistry, which determines its diverse physicochemical and thermal properties, could account for these markedly different outcomes after surgical implantation. To test this  hypothesis,  breakdown products from PLLA and PDLA, which are widely applied materials in patients, as well as stereocomplex PLA were examined herein to determine the  role  of  PLA  stereochemistry  in  activating  macrophages 18 and  fibroblasts 14 ,  key immune cells involved in host immune responses.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4315783734"},"_input_hash":47663761,"_task_hash":1451674195,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734041343,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"The survival of an organism is dependent on their ability to respond to cues in the environment. Such cues can attain control over behavior as a function of the value ascribed to them. Some individuals have an inherent tendency to attribute reward-paired cues with incentive motivational value, or incentive salience. For these individuals, termed sign-trackers, a discrete cue that precedes reward delivery becomes attractive and desirable in its own right. Prior work suggests that the behavior of sign-trackers is dopamine-dependent, and cue-elicited dopamine in the nucleus accumbens is believed to encode the incentive value of reward cues. Here we exploited the temporal resolution of optogenetics to determine whether selective inhibition of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons during cue presentation attenuates the propensity to sign-track. Using male tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-Cre Long Evans rats it was found that, under baseline conditions, ~84% of TH-Cre rats tend to sign-track. Laser-induced inhibition of VTA dopamine neurons during cue presentation prevented the development of signtracking behavior, without affecting goal-tracking behavior. When laser inhibition was terminated, these same rats developed a sign-tracking response. Video analysis using DeepLabCut revealed that, relative to rats that received laser inhibition, rats in the control group spent more time near the location of the reward cue even when it was not present and were more likely to orient towards and approach the cue during its presentation. These findings demonstrate that cue-elicited dopamine release is critical for the attribution of incentive salience to reward cues.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4372257879"},"_input_hash":1000199706,"_task_hash":1627760913,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734041353,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

We capitalized on the temporal precision of optogenetics to pair cue presentation with inhibition of VTA dopamine neurons. A detailed behavioral analysis with DeepLabCut revealed that cue-directed behaviors do not emerge without VTA dopamine. Importantly, however, when optogenetic inhibition is lifted, cue-directed behaviors increase, and a sign-tracking response develops.

{"text":"Associative learning strategies are utilized daily by humans and animals alike to make situational decisions. Such strategies often rely on cues, or stimuli, in the environment to guide behavior and can directly impact the survival of an organism. In rodents, individual differences in cue-motivated behaviors can be captured using a Pavlovian conditioned approach (PavCa) paradigm, wherein presentation of a discrete cue (conditioned stimulus, CS) is followed by delivery of a food reward (unconditioned stimulus, US) (Flagel et al., 2009). Following PavCa training, two distinct phenotypes emerge - goal-trackers (GT) and sign-trackers (ST) (Boakes, 1977; Hearst, 1974; Robinson & Flagel, 2009). While both GTs and STs attribute predictive value to the reward cue, STs also attribute incentive value to the cue. The attribution of incentive motivational value, or incentive salience, transforms the cue itself into an attractive and desirable stimulus (Berridge & Robinson, 2003). For STs, both food- and drug-associated cues gain appreciable incentive value and thereby the ability to elicit maladaptive behaviors (Saunders & Robinson, 2010, 2011; Yager et al., 2015; Yager & Robinson, 2013). The ST/GT model, therefore, can be harnessed to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms that encode the predictive versus incentive value of reward cues. Further, this model can help us better understand the neural processes that contribute to shared symptomatology between psychiatric disorders, as an increased propensity to attribute incentive salience to reward cues (i.e. to signtrack) has been associated with externalizing behaviors and deficits in executive control in both rodents and humans (Colaizzi et al., 2023; Flagel et al., 2010; Phillips & Sarter, 2020).","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4372257879"},"_input_hash":1614148762,"_task_hash":-1581898995,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734041364,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}
{"text":"Dopamine has been implicated in a number of psychiatric disorders, predominantly via its role in learning, attention, and motivation (Grace, 2016; Howes & Kapur, 2009; Nestler & Carlezon, 2006; Volkow et al., 2017). However, the precise role of dopamine remains a subject of debate, especially as it pertains to reward processing and learning about stimuli in the environment (Berke, 2018; Berridge, 2007; Lerner et al., 2021; Schultz et al., 2017). While dopamine has long been considered a prediction error signal (Schultz et al., 1997), used to update the predictive value of reward-cues during associative learning, deficiencies in this theory have been recognized (e.g., Jeong et al., 2022; Kutlu et al., 2021; Saunders et al., 2018; Sharpe et al., 2020). Of particular relevance, the sign-tracker/goal-tracker model previously revealed that intact dopamine signaling is necessary for the attribution of incentive salience to reward cues, or what we refer to here as Pavlovian 'incentive learning', and not the encoding of predictive value alone, or 'predictive learning' (Flagel et al., 2011; Saunders & Robinson, 2012; Yager et al., 2015). Both systemic and local (nucleus accumbens core) blockade of dopamine receptors prevents the acquisition and expression of a sign-tracking conditioned response with no effect on goal-tracking  (Flagel et al., 2011; Saunders & Robinson, 2012). Additionally, using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, it was shown that dopamine-encoded 'prediction error' signals are present in the nucleus accumbens core of sign-trackers, but not goal-trackers (Flagel et al., 2011). Together, these findings led to the conclusion that dopamine encodes the incentive value of Pavlovian reward cues. However, it was not clear from these studies whether dopamine activity precisely at the time of cue presentation is necessary for incentive value encoding and the acquisition of sign-tracking behavior. To address this question, we exploited the temporal resolution of optogenetics. Specifically, we utilized tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-Cre rats to selectively inhibit dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) during cue presentation early in Pavlovian training. We found that male TH-Cre Long Evans rats have an inherent tendency to sign-track, and that optogenetic inhibition of VTA dopamine neurons during cue presentation blocks this tendency, without affecting goal-tracking behavior. An in-depth analysis of behavior using DeepLabCut (Mathis et al., 2018) revealed that the effects of this manipulation were time-locked and specific to cue-elicited incentive motivation.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4372257879"},"_input_hash":-1403553522,"_task_hash":-1931122914,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734041374,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"PHB granules are bacterial organelles that store excess carbohydrates in the form of waterinsoluble  polyhydroxybutyrate  (PHB).  The  biogenesis  of  these  organelles  has  remained elusive. In this study, we show that PHB polymerase, phasin, and PHB synthesis are essential for PHB granule formation in Caulobacter crescentus . We show granule formation is initiated by the accumulation of PHB polymerase and subsequent recruitment of phasin. Phasin is a small amphipathic protein that is associated with PHB granules. Following the active synthesis of PHB, the polymerase dissociates from mature granules which coincides with recruitment of the  PHB  depolymerase. In  the  absence  of  phasin,  PHB  granules  remain  small  and  fail  to increase past 250nm in diameter. The polymerase directly binds phasin in vitro through its intrinsically  disordered  N-terminal  domain.  Deletion  of  the  polymerase  N-terminus in  vivo disrupts PHB granule formation and results in increased instability of the polymerase. Stability of the full-length polymerase is decreased under active PHB synthesis, potentially acting as a negative feedback loop on organelle biogenesis. Thus, the biogenesis of this membrane-less bacterial  organelle  uses  an  enzymatically  active  protein  boundary  to  control  the  size  and function of a carbon storage PHB granule.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4383550744"},"_input_hash":-1217763921,"_task_hash":-32979365,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734041382,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

Deletion of this Nterminus limits granule formation and deletion of phasin halts granule maturation, resulting in smaller PHB granules.

{"text":"Reducing meat consumption may improve human health, curb environmental damage, and limit the large-scale suffering of animals reared in factory farms. Most attention to reducing consumption has focused on restructuring environments where foods are chosen or on making health or environmental appeals. However, psychological theory suggests that interventions appealing to animal welfare concerns might operate on distinct, potent pathways. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the effectiveness of these interventions. We searched eight academic databases and extensively searched grey literature. We meta-analyzed 100 studies assessing interventions designed to reduce meat consumption or purchase by mentioning or portraying farm animals, that measured behavioral or self-reported outcomes related to meat consumption, purchase, or related intentions, and that had a control condition. The interventions consistently reduced meat consumption, purchase, or related intentions at least in the short term with meaningfully large effects (meta-analytic mean risk ratio [ RR ] = 1 . 22 ; 95% CI: [ 1 . 13 , 1 . 33 ]). We estimated that a large majority of true population effects ( 71 %; 95% CI: [ 59 %, 80 %]) were stronger than RR = 1 . 1 and that few were in the unintended direction. Via meta-regression, we identified some specific characteristics of studies and interventions that were associated with effect size. Risk-of-bias assessments identified both methodological strengths and limitations of this literature; however, results did not differ meaningfully in sensitivity analyses retaining only studies at the lowest risk of bias. Evidence of publication bias was not apparent. In conclusion, animal welfare interventions preliminarily appear effective in these typically short-term studies of primarily self-reported outcomes. Future research should use direct behavioral outcomes that minimize the potential for social desirability bias and are measured over long-term follow-up.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4245851024"},"_input_hash":262323296,"_task_hash":623047612,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734041444,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

After conducting initial searches, but before extracting data, we first registered the protocol on July 3, 2019. During data extraction, we updated the protocol to: (1) describe new plans to compare our results to those of a previous qualitative review 5 ; (2) change the way that we would handle multiple outcomes per study (from always choosing the broadest-scoped outcome to choosing the outcome most closely matching the intervention's scope, a change affecting only a few studies); and (3) we removed caveats about omitting certain analyses if estimates were non-normal in light of new statistical methods obviating this assumption 19 . With these changes, we registered the protocol again on July 16, 2019 and submitted this version to the journal Systematic Reviews . In response to peer review comments, we made further revisions to remove the comparison to the previous review. Ultimate analyses deviated from the published protocol paper 18 in four ways: (1) we extracted risk ratios rather than standardized mean differences because studies very often used pseudo-continuous, non-normal Likert outcomes, jeopardizing the validity of the needed effect-size conversions to the standardized mean difference scale; (2) we omitted the animal-centric, health-centric, environment-centric metrics; (3) we omitted sensitivity analyses that would have excluded interventions targeting consumption of only specific types of meat; and (4) we omitted self-selected within-subjects studies from main analyses.

{"text":"Achievement emotions are critical because of their impact on success and failure in important domains such as learning. These emotions may be modified via emotion regulation (ER). The dominant process model of ER (PMER; Gross, 1998, 2015), however, provides a domain-general account of ER strategies and has not had substantial contact with theories of achievement emotions such as Pekrun's (2006) control-value theory (CVT) and the academic achievement literature. Moreover, ER has not been a focal point of major theories related to achievement emotions, such as CVT. We propose an integrated model of ER in achievement situations (ERAS) that integrates propositions about the generation of emotions from CVT with propositions about how emotions are regulated and types of ER strategies from PMER. The ERAS model also offers new propositions regarding how different achievement situations, object foci, and time frames, as well as discrete emotions with different appraisal patterns, impact ER strategies.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W2942725897"},"_input_hash":1399325842,"_task_hash":2117340069,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734041526,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"When a student blames himself for getting a low mark on an important test, he may experience negative emotions such as shame and guilt. These emotions might motivate him to redouble his efforts or change his studying habits to improve his grade in the class. On the other hand, he might be so ashamed that he just gives up on doing well in the course altogether. As shown in this hypothetical situation, emotions are triggered in response to goal-related situational events, and one of the reasons they are so important is because of the ways they shape our behavior to protect or advance our goals. In another hypothetical situation, a student might feel relief after a successful and high-stakes class presentation and collapse in front of the television after school to recharge. She might, however, surrender so thoroughly to relief that she forgets to study for an exam or lets the relief transition to pride and overconfidence that leads her to minimize further studying-to her academic peril. These examples highlight that both negative (shame) and positive (e.g., relief) emotions can lead to outcomes that are either aligned or misaligned with students' academic goals, depending on how they deal with these emotions. As such, the goodness of fit between emotions-whatever they are-and academic success lies in how students regulate them.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W2942725897"},"_input_hash":409628100,"_task_hash":-1116813710,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734041528,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"Abstract: The study of quantum gravity in the form of the holographic duality has uncovered and motivated the detailed investigation of various diagnostics of quantum chaos. One such measure is the operator size distribution, which characterizes the size of the support region of an operator and its evolution under Heisenberg evolution. In this work, we examine the role of the operator size distribution in holographic duality for the SachdevYe-Kitaev (SYK) model. Using an explicit construction of AdS 2 bulk fermion operators in a putative dual of the low temperature SYK model, we study the operator size distribution of the boundary and bulk fermions.

{"text":"In recent years, significant progress has been made on characterizing quantum chaos in many-body systems. Developments in the study of holographic duality[1] pointed out a close connection between chaotic many-body dynamics and gravitational physics, especially black hole dynamics[2, 3]. Motivated by this connection, new characteristics of quantum chaos have been studied, such as the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC)[3-6]. The OTOC can be viewed as a quantum generalization of the Poisson bracket in classical dynamics. In the classical case, the Poisson bracket of canonical coordinates x ( t ) with the coordinates at an earlier time x (0) determines how sensitive the trajectory is to initial conditions, which characterizes chaos and is related to Lyapunov exponents. Similarly, the OTOC provides a measure of 'operator scrambling' - how operators become more complicated under Heisenberg evolution. The decrease of the OTOC corresponds to an increase of the commutator between two operators A ( t ) at time t and B (0) at time 0 , which captures that the support of A ( t ) in operator space grows.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3005397613"},"_input_hash":-1018725753,"_task_hash":-1643543683,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734041537,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}
{"text":"Another related measure of operator scrambling is the operator size distribution[7, 8]. By expanding each operator in a polynomial of simple operators, such as single Pauli operators in a spin chain, or single fermion creation/annihilation operators in a fermion system, one obtains a superposition of terms, each of which is a product of multiple simple building blocks. This leads to a definition of operator size distribution as the distribution of support over products of different lengths. A single Pauli operator in a spin chain has size 1 , while a product of two Pauli's on two sites has size 2 . An operator's size distribution provides a more sophisticated characteristic of its complexity than the OTOC. It was also shown that a particular average of OTOCs gives the average size, i.e. the first moment of the operator size distribution[8, 9]. The operator size distribution have been studied in various models including the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models[8, 9] and spin models[10-12]. Finite temperature generalizations of (effective) operator size has been discussed recently[13, 14]. Interestingly, the operator size distribution has also been related to a certain momentum quantum number in the holographic dual theory[8, 15-18].","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3005397613"},"_input_hash":1421148942,"_task_hash":-571786005,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734041538,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}
{"text":"Here, we investigate the role of operator size distribution in holographic duality by studying the bulk operator size in the dual theory of SYK model. The SYK model has been proposed to be dual to Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity[19, 20] with certain bulk matter content. Although the duality is not completely proven, from the behavior of the boundary fermion in the SYK model (a conformal field with known conformal dimension, and largeN factorization) it is reasonable to apply the known dictionary and determine the corresponding bulk fermion field. In this paper, we compute the size distribution of the boundary Majorana field in the low temperature, large N limit of SYK, using a method inspired by a combination of [9] and [21] that makes clear the connection of this boundary quantity to bulk quantities for a fermion in static AdS 2 . Then, in close analogy with previous work for fields with other spin [22-25] (often referred to collectively as the Hamilton-Kabat-Lifschytz-Lowe, or HKLL, constructions), we give an explicit construction of the bulk fermion operator in terms of the boundary Majoranas.

{"text":"Whole-body control (WBC) is a generic task-oriented control method for feedback control of loco-manipulation behaviors in humanoid robots. The combination of WBC and model-based walking controllers has been widely utilized in various humanoid robots. However, to date, the WBC method has not been employed for unsupported passiveankle dynamic locomotion. As such, in this paper, we devise a new WBC, dubbed whole-body locomotion controller (WBLC), that can achieve experimental dynamic walking on unsupported passive-ankle biped robots. A key aspect of WBLC is the relaxation of contact constraints such that the control commands produce reduced jerk when switching foot contacts. To achieve robust dynamic locomotion, we conduct an in-depth analysis of uncertainty for our dynamic walking algorithm called time-to-velocity-reversal (TVR) planner. The uncertainty study is fundamental as it allows us to improve the control algorithms and mechanical structure of our robot to fulfill the tolerated uncertainty. In addition, we conduct extensive experimentation for: 1) unsupported dynamic balancing (i.e. in-place stepping) with a six degreeof-freedom (DoF) biped, Mercury; 2) unsupported directional walking with Mercury; 3) walking over an irregular and slippery terrain with Mercury; and 4) in-place walking with our newly designed ten-DoF viscoelastic liquid-cooled biped, DRACO. Overall, the main contributions of this work are on: a) achieving various modalities of unsupported dynamic locomotion of passive-ankle bipeds using a WBLC controller and a TVR planner, b) conducting an uncertainty analysis to improve the mechanical structure and the controllers of Mercury, and c) devising a whole-body control strategy that reduces movement jerk during walking.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W2914653242"},"_input_hash":-1040482489,"_task_hash":1297657534,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734041555,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"Passive-ankle walking has some key differences with respect to ankle actuated biped legged locomotion: 1) bipeds with passive ankles have lesser degrees-of-freedom (DoF) than ankle actuated legged robots resulting in lower mechanical complexity and lighter lower legs. 2) bipeds with passive ankles have tiny feet which lead to a small horizontal footprint of the robot. Our paper targets passive and quasi-passive ankle legged robots in leverage the above characteristics.

(1984) that do not rely on explicit control of the horizontal CoM movement enabling passiveankle walking and also fulfilling many of the benefits listed above. These controllers use foot placements as a control mechanism to stabilize the under-actuated horizontal CoM dynamics. At no point, they attempt to directly control the CoM instantaneous state. Instead, they calculate a control policy in which the foot location is a feedback weighted sum of the sensed CoM state. Our dynamic locomotion control policy falls into this category of controllers albeit using a particular CoM feedback gain matrix based on the concept of time-to-velocity-reversal (TVR) Kim et al.

Additionally, our decision to use a low level joint-level control is supported by previous studies that torque control reduces the ability to achieve a highimpedance behavior Calanca et al.

{"text":"From the uncertainty analysis of our TVR dynamic locomotion planner, we found that to achieve stable locomotion the robot requires higher position tracking accuracy than initially expected. Our uncertainty analysis concludes that the landing foot positions need to be controlled within a 1 cm error and the CoM state needs to be estimated within a 0.5 cm error. Both the robot's posture control and the swing foot control require high tracking accuracy. For this reason, we remove the torque feedback in the low-level controller and instead impose a feedforward current command to compensate for wholebody inertial, Coriolis, and gravitational effects.

Indeed, in our formulation, we avoid formulating contacts as hard constraints Herzog et al. (2016); Saab et al. (2013); Wensing and Orin (2013) and instead include them as a cost function. We then use the cost weights associated with the contacts to change behavior during contact transitions in a way that it significantly reduces movement jerk. For instance, when we apply heavy cost weights to the contact accelerations, we effectively emulate the effect of contact constraints. During foot detachment, we continuously reduce the contact cost weights. By doing so, we accomplish smooth transitions as the contact conditions change. An approach based on whole-body inverse dynamics has been proposed for smooth task transitions Salini et al. (2011), but has not been proposed for contact transitions like ours, neither has it been implemented in experimental platforms.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W2914653242"},"_input_hash":-1949543161,"_task_hash":-2145765461,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734041573,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}
{"text":"The above WBLC and joint-level position feedback controller can achieve high fidelity real-time control of bipeds and humanoid robots. For locomotion control, we employ the time-to-velocity-reversal (TVR) planner presented in Kim et al. (2016). We use the TVR planner to update foot landing locations at every step as a function of the CoM state. And we do so by planning in the middle of leg swing motions. By continuously updating the foot landing locations, bipeds accomplish dynamic walking that is robust to control errors and to external disturbances. The capability of our walking controller is extensively tested in a passive-ankle biped robot and in a quasi-passive ankle lower body humanoid robot. By relying on foot landing location commands, our control scheme is generic to various types of bipeds and therefore, we can accomplish similar walking capabilities across various robots by simply switching the robot parameters. To demonstrate the generality of our controller, we test not only two experimental bipeds but also a simulation of other humanoid robots.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W2914653242"},"_input_hash":1232013662,"_task_hash":-1076033948,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734041574,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"Voters in almost every state elect county sheriffs but political science has only recently turned its attention to this important office. In this paper, I trace the historical processes that led Americans to begin electing sheriffs in the 18th and 19th centuries, as well as modern reforms to reverse that trend. Pairing newly-collected data on the timing of reforms that democratized local offices with narrative history, I show that the institution of elected sheriff spread gradually across the country and, in many states, Americans were deeply conflicted about subjecting this important office to popular choice. One finding is that sheriffs, in most states, became elective sooner than prosecutors and judges. I also provide evidence of the institution's slow retrenchment: today, there are four states and thirteen counties, home to over 20 million Americans, that do not elect sheriffs. The paper concludes with a discussion about the national importance of this local institution in American politics.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3045625995"},"_input_hash":-448142572,"_task_hash":409838867,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734041639,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"Over 3,000 county sheriffs hold office in the United States and 99 percent are directly elected by voters. Sheriffs operate law enforcement departments in the vast majority of counties, employ 25% of full-time sworn officers, and oversee 85% of local jails (Brooks 2019, Reaves and Hickman 1998). State constitutions and local laws grant sheriffs wide-ranging discretion to set law enforcement priorities, and sheriffs today are important actors in a number of policy arenas, including gun control, immigration, and public health (Brown 1978, Falcone and Wells 1995, Farris and Holman 2015, Farris and Holman 2017, Thompson 2020a). At the same time, there is an ongoing debate about monitoring the behavior of sheriffs and other police. Incumbent sheriffs are infrequently challenged at the ballot box and win reelection at high rates (Zoorob 2019a), and there is growing concern that sheriffs' elections do not deliver accountability (Neauhauser 2016, Magary 2018, Tomberlin 2018). Examples of sheriffs misbehaving in office, before 1 and after 2 elections, are abundant, and lead many Americans to wonder about the origins and persistence of this institution.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3045625995"},"_input_hash":162427625,"_task_hash":-947002175,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734041645,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

The underlying reasons for adopting elected sheriffs was a principal-agent problem that political elites faced when the need to fill public offices was frustrated by the executive branch's patronage excesses.

{"text":"Taking a broader perspective, the asymptotic Plateau problem in H 2 \u00d7 R asks for a characterization of those curves (or closed subsets) in the asymptotic boundary of H 2 \u00d7 R which bound complete minimal surfaces. Implicit in this question is a choice of compactification of this space. This question is discussed in some generality in [7]; in the present paper we consider only the product compactification ( H 2 \u00d7 R ) \u00d7 = H 2 \u00d7 R , which is the product of a closed disk and a closed interval, and only consider boundary curves lying in the vertical part of the boundary H 2 \u00d7 R .

The simplest problem is to determine whether any connected horizontal curve bounds a minimal surface, and this was settled by Nelli and Rosenberg [14]. They proved that if \u03b3 ( \u03b8 ) \u2208 C 0 ( S 1 ) , then there exists a unique function u defined on the disk {| z | < 1 } , with u = \u03b3 at r = 1 , such that the graph of u is minimal in H 2 \u00d7 R .

Second, and of fundamental importance, we pass from the space of properly embedded to (properly) Alexandrov-embedded minimal annuli with embedded ends. We denote this space by A \u2217 . It is most likely impossible to characterize the precise set of pairs of boundary curves for which the minimal annuli provided by this theorem are actually embedded, but if we allow Alexandrov-embeddedness, there is a satisfactory global existence theorem.

{"text":"Mechanotransduction  at  cell-cell  adhesions  is  crucial  for  the  structural  integrity,  organization,  and morphogenesis of epithelia.  At  cell-cell  junctions,  ternary  E-cadherin/\u03b2-catenin/\u03b1E-catenin  complexes sense and transmit mechanical load by binding to F-actin. The interaction with F-actin, described as a two-state catch bond, is weak in solution but is strengthened by applied force due to force-dependent transitions between weak and strong actin-binding states. Here, we provide direct evidence from optical trapping  experiments  that  the  catch  bond  property  principally  resides  in  the  \u03b1E-catenin  actin-binding domain (ABD). Consistent with our previously proposed model, deletion of the first helix of the five-helix ABD bundle enables stable interactions with F-actin under minimal load that are well-described by a single-state slip bond, even when \u03b1E-catenin is complexed with \u03b2-catenin and E-cadherin. Our data argue for a conserved catch bond mechanism for adhesion proteins with structurally similar ABDs. We also demonstrate  that  a  stably  bound  ABD  strengthens  load-dependent  binding  interactions  between  a neighboring complex and F-actin, but the presence of the other \u03b1E-catenin domains weakens this effect. These results provide mechanistic insight to the cooperative binding of the cadherin-catenin complex to F-actin, which regulate dynamic cytoskeletal linkages in epithelial tissues.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4229365847"},"_input_hash":-156878752,"_task_hash":1496368409,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734041802,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}
{"text":"The physical integrity and long-range organization of epithelial tissues are mediated in large part by dynamic  linkages  between  intercellular  adhesion  complexes  and  the  actomyosin  cytoskeleton. Intercellular  adhesions  actively  remodel  in  response  to  both  external  and  cytoskeletally  generated mechanical forces, both to reinforce tissues against forces that might otherwise threaten tissue integrity, and  to  drive  cell-cell  rearrangements  that  underlie  embryonic  morphogenesis  and  wound  healing (Charras and Yap, 2018; Ladoux and M\u00e8ge, 2017). Mechanotransduction at cell-cell adhesions likewise plays a central role in maintaining tissue homeostasis, and its dysregulation is associated with diseases such as metastatic cancer (Ding et al., 2010; Vasioukhin, 2012).

{"text":"Adherens junctions are essential intracellular adhesion sites in epithelial tissues. In these junctions, the extracellular domain of E-cadherin forms contacts between neighboring cells, and the intracellular domain binds \u03b2-catenin. \u03b2-Catenin binds to \u03b1E-catenin, which binds directly to F-actin (Desai et al., 2013; Meng and Takeichi, 2009; Rimm et al., 1995; Shapiro and Weis, 2009) (Figure 1A). The ternary E-cadherin/\u03b2catenin/\u03b1E-catenin complex forms weak, transient interactions with F-actin in the absence of external load  (Drees  et  al.,  2005;  Miller  et  al.,  2013;  Yamada  et  al.,  2005).  However,  single-molecule  force measurements  revealed  that  mechanical  force  strengthens  binding  interactions  between  the  ternary cadherin-catenin complex and F-actin (Buckley et al., 2014). This property, known as a catch bond, is thought to help reinforce intercellular adhesion under tension. Because the observed distribution of bond survival lifetimes between the cadherin-catenin complex and F-actin is biexponential, this interaction is best described by a two-state catch bond model defined by two distinct actin-bound states, weak and strong (Buckley et al., 2014). In this model, force enhances the transition from the weak to strong state, which results in longer binding lifetimes at higher load. Transitions between bound states are thought to arise from structural rearrangements in \u03b1E-catenin, which is allosterically modulated by binding partners and by mechanical load (le Duc et al., 2010; Maki et al., 2016; Mei et al., 2020; Terekhova et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2020; Yonemura et al., 2010). The catch bond interaction is directional, such that force applied towards the pointed (-) end of the polar actin  filament results in longer-lived bonds than when force is applied towards the barbed (+) end (Arbore et al., 2022; Bax et al., 2022).","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4229365847"},"_input_hash":1756558939,"_task_hash":-1182600444,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734041803,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}
{"text":"\u03b1E-catenin consists of an N-terminal (N) \u03b2-catenin binding-domain, a middle (M) domain, and a flexible linker to a C-terminal actin-binding domain (ABD) (Pokutta et al., 2014; Pokutta and Weis, 2000) (Figure 1B). Several lines of evidence suggest conformational changes within the \u03b1E-catenin ABD, a five-helix bundle (H1-H5) with a short N-terminal helix (H0), underlie catch bond formation (Ishiyama et al., 2018, 2013; Rangarajan and Izard, 2013). Two recent structural studies (Mei et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020) showed that whereas the structure of F-actin is essentially unchanged by complex formation, the ABD N-terminus through the last turn of H1 becomes disordered and helices H2-H5 repack, and the C-terminal peptide (CTE, aa 844-906) that follows H5 becomes partially ordered and interacts with actin (Figure 2A). Consistent with the reported structures, we showed that removal of H0 and H1 produced 18x stronger binding of the ABD to F-actin in solution (Xu et al., 2020). Based on these structural and biochemical findings, we proposed that the observed four-helix, actin-bound ABD conformation represents the strong F-actin bound state (Figure 2B).","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4229365847"},"_input_hash":1045459053,"_task_hash":1221597539,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734041804,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

However, people have empirically observed that the shape of the noise also has a strong (if not stronger) implicit bias. For example, prior works show that mini-batch noise or label noise (label smoothing) - noise in the parameter updates from the perturbation of labels in training - is far more effective than adding spherical Gaussian noise (e.g., see (Shallue et al., 2018, Section 4.6) and (Szegedy et al., 2016, Wen et al., 2019)).

Such an understanding may also be applicable to distributed training because synthetically adding noise may help generalization if parallelism reduces the amount of mini-batch noise (Shallue et al., 2018).","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3177095392"},"_input_hash":896136383,"_task_hash":-1137688612,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734041825,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"In our setting, we prove that with a proper learning rate schedule, SGD with label noise recovers a sparse ground-truth classifier and generalizes well, whereas SGD with spherical Gaussian noise generalizes poorly. Concretely, SGD with label noise biases the parameter towards sparse solutions and exactly recovers the sparse ground-truth, even when the initialization is arbitrarily large (Theorem 2.1). In this same regime, noise-free gradient descent quickly overfits because it trains in the NTK regime (Arora et al., 2019b, Chizat and Bach, 2018, Du et al., 2018b, Jacot et al., 2018, Oymak and Soltanolkotabi, 2020). Adding Gaussian noise is insufficient to fix this, as this algorithm would end up sampling from a Gibbs distribution with infinite partition function and fail to converge to the ground-truth (Theorem 2.2). In summary, with not too small learning rate or noise level, label noise suffices to bias the parameter towards sparse solutions without relying on a small initialization, whereas Gaussian noise cannot.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3177095392"},"_input_hash":-535261897,"_task_hash":1502858874,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734041828,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}
{"text":"Our analysis suggests that the fundamental difference between label or mini-batch noise and Gaussian noise is that the former is parameter-dependent, and therefore introduces stronger biases than the latter. The conceptual message highlighted by our analysis is that there are two possible implicit biases induced by the noise: 1. prior work (Keskar et al., 2016) shows that by escaping sharp local minima, noisy gradient descent biases the parameter towards solutions which are more robust (i.e, solutions with low curvature, or 'flat' minima), and 2. when the noise covariance varies across the parameter space, there is another (potentially stronger) implicit bias effect toward parameters where the noise covariance is smaller. Label or mini-batch noise benefit from both biases, whereas Gaussian noise is independent of the parameter, so it benefits from the first bias but not the second. For the quadratically-parameterized model, this first bias is not sufficient for finding solutions with good generalization because there is a large set of overfitting global minima of the training loss with reasonable curvature. In contrast, the covariance of label noise is proportional to the scale of the parameter, inducing a much stronger bias towards low norm solutions which generalize well.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3177095392"},"_input_hash":-1786037941,"_task_hash":1029900297,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734041828,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"Irrigated agriculture contributes 40% of total global food production. In the US High Plains, which produces more than 50 million tons per year of grain, as much as 90% of irrigation originates from groundwater resources, including the Ogallala aquifer. In parts of the High Plains, groundwater resources are being depleted so rapidly that they are considered nonrenewable, compromising food security. When groundwater becomes scarce, groundwater withdrawals peak, causing a subsequent peak in crop production. Previous descriptions of finite natural resource depletion have utilized the Hubbert curve. By coupling the dynamics of groundwater pumping, recharge, and crop production, Hubbert-like curves emerge, responding to the linked variations in groundwater pumping and grain production. On a state level, this approach predicted when groundwater withdrawal and grain production peaked and the lag between them. The lags increased with the adoption of efficient irrigation practices and higher recharge rates. Results indicate that, in Texas, withdrawals peaked in 1966, followed by a peak in grain production 9 y later. After better irrigation technologies were adopted, the lag increased to 15 y from 1997 to 2012. In Kansas, where these technologies were employed concurrently with the rise of irrigated grain production, this lag was predicted to be 24 y starting in 1994. In Nebraska, grain production is projected to continue rising through 2050 because of high recharge rates. While Texas and Nebraska had equal irrigated output in 1975, by 2050, it is projected that Nebraska will have almost 10 times the groundwater-based production of Texas.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3091005730"},"_input_hash":1690309043,"_task_hash":-423458620,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734041853,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"Previous projections of the future of groundwater withdrawals in the HPA were inspired by Hubbert's (9) 1962 analysis of US crude oil production. Hubbert foreshadowed the peak in oil production that occurred in the mid-1970s (10), and, now, the symmetric curve describing the rise, peak, and fall in oil production is known as the 'Hubbert curve.' The idea of fitting nonrenewable resource use trends with a 'Hubbert curve' has since gained prominence (11, 12), and an analogy between oil production and groundwater withdrawals was used to suggest the inevitability of peak nonrenewable water withdrawal (hereafter, peak water) as a parallel to peak oil (13). Hubbertlike groundwater withdrawal patterns have been documented in many regions around the world (e.g., numerous basins in India, the North China Plains, California's Central Valley) where groundwater withdrawals are much higher than their recharge (13). Moreover, forecasts of HPA groundwater extraction and future availability have benefited from fitting measurements of well water levels with the logistic function, the antiderivative of the Hubbert curve (14, 15).","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3091005730"},"_input_hash":-224011051,"_task_hash":-2011351158,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734041861,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

This approach was applied to groundwater use and crop production on the HPA of Texas, Kansas, and Nebraska. Lags between peak water and peak grain and the asymmetric trends of groundwater withdrawal and crop production about their peaks were projected and related to aquifer lifespan. The approach additionally offers a perspective on what technological disruptions, such as the introduction of low-energy precision application (LEPA) irrigation in Texas, mean in the context of peak water and peak grain.

{"text":"The proposed approach was used to assess increases in aquifer lifespan due to groundwater withdrawal reduction programs such as the Local Enhanced Management Area program in Kansas ( SI Appendix , Supplementary Text ) (33). The dynamical systems approach can also be extended to explore groundwater withdrawal-crop production systems worldwide. For example, groundwater in the alluvial aquifer systems of northwestern India is an indispensable source of both drinking and agricultural water for some of India's most agriculturally productive land. Intense extraction of this resource has posed challenges on water quantity but also quality; high salinity and concentrations of fluoride, nitrate, and uranium are widespread in this aquifer (34, 35).

{"text":"Irrigated agricultural production in the US High Plains has pursued growth beyond sustainable limits set by groundwater resources and their recharge (2). Delays in introducing adequate responses to approaching these limits, through enforcement of policies (37) and extensive water use reporting (21), have resulted in unsustainable rates of groundwater use causing the phenomenon of peak water followed by peak grain. The proposed approach has shown that the consequence of these peaks is an eventual collapse in withdrawal and production trends. It has also revealed that the lag between the peaks and the asymmetry of the trends increase as the historical magnitude of groundwater withdrawals is more commensurate with recharge and available resources. On the HPA, coarser soils in the Sand Hills (increasing recharge) (18) and surface water capture (19) have endowed Nebraska with a long aquifer lifespan, whereas, in Texas, aggressive use of this resource has twice resulted in rapid crashes following peak water and peak grain within only four decades.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3091005730"},"_input_hash":-79160506,"_task_hash":-1816390265,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734041878,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"In most eukaryotic cells fatty acid synthesis occurs in the cytoplasm as well as in mitochondria.  However, the relative contribution of mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS) to the cellular lipidome of metazoans is illdefined.  Hence,  we  studied  the  function  of  the  fly  Mitochondria  enoyl  CoA  reductase  (Mecr),  the  enzyme required  for  the  last  step  of  mtFAS.  Loss  of mecr causes  lethality  while  neuronal  loss  leads  to  progressive neurological defects. We observe an elevated level of ceramides, a defect in Fe-S cluster biogenesis and increased iron levels in mecr mutants. Reducing the levels of either iron or ceramide suppresses the neurodegenerative phenotypes indicating that increased ceramides and iron metabolism are interrelated and play an important role in  the  pathogenesis.  Mutations  in  human MECR cause  pediatric-onset  neurodegeneration  and  patient-derived fibroblasts display similar elevated ceramide levels and impaired iron homeostasis. In summary, this study shows an as-yet-unidentified role of mecr / MECR in ceramide and iron metabolism providing a mechanistic link between mtFAS and neurodegeneration.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4366211166"},"_input_hash":27681424,"_task_hash":291076856,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734041896,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"The cytoplasmic fatty acid synthesis pathway produces palmitate (C16) linked to the CoA cofactor, which is used for the synthesis of lipids including phospholipids and sphingolipids. In contrast, mtFAS produces acyl chains of varying carbon length (C4 to C18) linked to mitochondrial Acyl Carrier Protein (mtACP/ACP) 15-18 . Lipoic acid, an essential cofactor for multiple mitochondrial enzymes 19 is derived from octanoyl (C8)-ACP 17,20 . However, the role of the other Acyl-ACPs in lipid synthesis is not well defined. Indeed, the consequences of impaired mtFAS on the cellular lipidome  have remained elusive based on studies in  yeast,  Neurospora,  and mammalian cell lines 6,21-23 . For example, loss of Mecr in murine C2C12 myoblast cells was reported to not affect any major cellular phospholipids 6 . However, a reduction of mtACP caused decreased levels of lysophospholipids and sphingolipids in HeLa cells 23 . In contrast, in Neurospora crassa , mtACP mutants displayed an increase in mitochondrial  lysophospholipid  levels 21 .  In Trypansosoma  bruci ,  RNAi  mediated  knockdown  of  mtACP decreased the phosphoinositides and phosphoethanolamine levels but it did not alter sphingomyelin levels 22 . Finally, upon loss of mtACP in yeast, no major difference in mitochondrial lipids and fatty acids was noted 21 .

{"text":"The electrochemical reduction of CO 2 (CO 2 RR) to higher-order hydrocarbons or oxygenates using lowcarbon electricity offers a promising path to generate renewable fuels and chemicals; however, the low selectivity of present-day CO 2 RR catalysts toward more valuable C 3 products limits technoeconomically compelling avenues toward productization. Systematically enumerating possible intermediates and reactions to the set of possible {C 1 , C 2 , and C 3 } CO 2 RR products entails 3206 intermediates and 4506 reactions. Here we use graph theory to enumerate these possibilities comprehensively, treating intermediates as graph nodes and pathways as graph edges. C 3 products fall into two groups, group A (1propanol, allyl alcohol, and propionaldehyde) and group B (acetone and hydroxyacetone); and we  nd that an early branch reaction, three steps after C 1 -C 2 coupling, bifurcates these two groups of C 3 products.  We develop a set of C 3 descriptors and screen catalysts for CO2RR to C 3 products: speci cally, we screen bimetallic (doped Cu) catalysts for their combination of CO binding, C 1 -C 1 coupling and C 1 -C 2 coupling. Cu and also Au- and Ag-doped Cu ful ll the  rst two requirements; but the set of promising C 1 -C 2 coupling catalysts (Ni-doped Pb and Al-doped Pb) needed to get to C 3 is nonoverlapping with that for CO binding and C 1 -C 1 coupling. Our  ndings agree with the experimental picture that Cu, while among the most productive to propanol, has been limited in F.E. to the 10-20% range; and that, to date, no single catalyst has achieved exceptional C 3 productivity. We discuss tandem catalyst designs where a  rst catalyst promotes CO binding and C 1 -C 1 , and where these C 2 and C 1 intermediates can come together for coupling on a second distinct class of integrated catalysts.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3133101250"},"_input_hash":1354720477,"_task_hash":-1144215312,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734041969,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

Further, a quantitative approach will be required: rather than reject certain pathways as unlikely, we propose a quantitative analysis of the energetics of each possible pathway.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3133101250"},"_input_hash":1461771844,"_task_hash":1333456780,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734041973,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"Psychological states in uence our happiness and productivity; however, estimates of their impact have historically been assumed to be limited by the accuracy with which introspection can quantify them. Over the last two decades, studies have shown that introspective descriptions of psychological states correlate with objective indicators of cognition, including task performance and metrics of brain function, using techniques like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Such evidence suggests it may be possible to quantify the mapping between self-reports of experience and 'ground-truth' or biologically related representations of those states (e.g., those inferred from measures of brain activity). Here, we used machine learning to show that self-reported descriptions of experiences across tasks can reliably map the objective landscape of task states derived from brain activity. In our study, participants provided descriptions of their psychological states while performing tasks for which the contribution of different brain systems was available from prior fMRI studies. We used machine learning to combine these reports with descriptions of brain function to form a 'state-space' that reliably predicted patterns of brain activity based solely on unseen descriptions of experience. Our study demonstrates that introspection contains information that maps the objective task landscape inferred from brain activity.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4393028888"},"_input_hash":900086467,"_task_hash":-1967347545,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734042043,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}
{"text":"Variation in psychological states plays a prominent role in the health, well-being, and productivity of members of society 3 . Descriptions of psychological states are made possible by the uniquely human capacity for introspection 4 . For almost a century, however, uncertainty regarding the accuracy of introspection has meant that relationships identi ed in this way are often treated with scepticism 1,5 . Recent work has successfully combined data derived from introspective reports with laboratory techniques that map objective features of behavior, establishing that when collected appropriately, introspective data can contain meaningful information regarding underlying psychological processes (for reviews, see: 6-9 ). In particular, correlational studies conducted over the last two decades using experience sampling have established relationships between self-reported descriptions of experience and objective indicators of cognition, such as task performance 10 , changes in behavior in daily life 11,12 , and covert measures of cognition derived from state-of-the-art brain imaging that describes both brain function 13-15 and structure 16 . These correlational studies establish that self-reported descriptions of experiential states could, in principle, be used as a tool to map objective descriptions of human cognition.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4393028888"},"_input_hash":-101583750,"_task_hash":648860887,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734042044,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"The words \"violence\" and \"nonviolence\" are increasingly misleading translations for the Sanskrit words hi\u1e43s\u0101 and ahi\u1e43s\u0101 -- which were used by Gandhi as the basis for his philosophy of saty\u0101graha . I argue for re-reading hi\u1e43s\u0101 as 'maleficence' and ahi\u1e43s\u0101 as 'beneficence.' These two more mind-referring English words - associated with religiously contextualized discourse of the past -- capture the primacy of intention implied by Gandhi's core principles, better than 'violence' and 'nonviolence' do. Reflecting a political turn in moral accountability detectable through linguistic data, both the scope and the usage of the word 'violence' have expanded dramatically. The expanded scope of 'violence' reflects greater consciousness of the various forms that serious harm can take, but also makes it harder to convincingly characterize people and actions as 'nonviolent.' New translations could clarify the distinction between hi\u1e43s\u0101 and ahi\u1e43s\u0101 , and thereby prevent some misunderstandings of Gandhi. Training in beneficence would reflect Gandhi's psychological path to reducing avoidable harm: detachment from the ego, learning to love universally, and seeking truth by experiment.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4212832069"},"_input_hash":-1424904066,"_task_hash":-88215358,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734042060,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the greatest challenges to face society in generations. As the public sector takes the lead in responding to, mitigating, and helping resolve the crisis, we are reminded of the fundamental importance of an effective state. States are not only expected to craft and deliver high-quality public health systems during this pandemic, but must also address the strains on ordinarily routine processes of governance. In economically developed states, for instance,  welfare  administrators  are  processing  unprecedented  numbers  of  requests  for  social support and officials are crafting policies to minimize economic damage (Cohen 2020). In the developing world, government agencies are coordinating the delivery of essential items to the poor such as food and medicine as social safety net systems collapse (Kazmin et al. 2020). An effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic thus requires effective administration. Effective administration in turn crucially depends on the effort and capacity of the millions of public sector workers from the frontline to central administration. However, for many public sector workers, COVID-19 has fundamentally changed where and how they work, the demands their job places on them and the demands they face outside their jobs.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3028990183"},"_input_hash":671773018,"_task_hash":195538369,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734042151,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

Due to the PSID's survey questions, most of the early research uses spending on food as the measure of consumption or an imputed measure of non-durable consumption based on spending on food and demographic characteristics. 1 In 1999, the PSID introduced a fuller measure of consumption and also started collecting information on wealth in every wave of the survey. Before 1999, the PSID consumption data were limited to spending on food and housing.

{"text":"Abstract -Accurate, long-term forecasting of pedestrian trajectories in highly dynamic and interactive scenes is a longstanding challenge. Recent advances in using data-driven approaches have achieved significant improvements in terms of prediction accuracy. However, the lack of group-aware analysis has limited the performance of forecasting models. This is especially nonnegligible in highly crowded scenes, where pedestrians are moving in groups and the interactions between groups are extremely complex and dynamic. In this paper, we present Grouptron, a multi-scale dynamic forecasting framework that leverages pedestrian group detection and utilizes individual-level, group-level and scene-level information for better understanding and representation of the scenes. Our approach employs spatio-temporal clustering algorithms to identify pedestrian groups, creates spatio-temporal graphs at the individual, group, and scene levels. It then uses graph neural networks to encode dynamics at different scales and aggregate the embeddings for trajectory prediction. We conducted extensive comparisons and ablation experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our method achieves 9.3% decrease in final displacement error (FDE) compared with state-of-the-art methods on ETH/UCY benchmark datasets, and 16.1% decrease in FDE in more crowded scenes where extensive human group interactions are more frequently present.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3202546816"},"_input_hash":-715241496,"_task_hash":1424429104,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734042283,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

Hence, generative approaches have become the state-ofthe-art trajectory forecasting methods, due to recent advancements in deep generative models [14], [15] and their ability of generating distributions of potential future trajectories (instead of a single future trajectory). Most of these methods use a recurrent neural network architecture with a latent variable model, such as a conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE) [2], [16], [17], [18], or a generative adversarial network (GAN) [19], [20], [21], [22], [23] to encode multi-modality.

The spatio-temporal graphs model complex and highly dynamic pedestrian interactions at three scales: the individual level, the group level, and the scene level. Grouptron detects pedestrian groups using agglomerative clustering based on Hausdorff distances, uses GCNs and LSTM-based networks to encode information at different scales, and combines the embeddings across scales. With these novel designs, Grouptron achieves high performance even in situations that are tough for state-of-the-art methods. Through extensive experiments, we show that Grouptron outperforms state-ofart methods on ETH and UCY datasets, which are standard benchmarks in the field. Furthermore, through qualitative comparisons and experiments run on densely populated UNIV-N test sets, we show that Grouptron outperforms stateof-art methods by even larger margins and is robust to the change in the number of pedestrians in the scene.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3202546816"},"_input_hash":358137548,"_task_hash":-1783227997,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734042322,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"In this paper we study estimation of and inference for average treatment effects in a setting with panel data. We focus on the setting where units, e.g., individuals, firms, or states, adopt the policy or treatment of interest at a particular point in time, and then remain exposed to this treatment at all times afterwards. The adoption date at which units are first exposed to the policy may, but need not, vary by unit. We refer to this as a staggered adoption design (SAD), such designs are sometimes also referred to as event study designs. An early example is Athey and Stern [1998] where adoption of an enhanced 911 technology by counties occurs over time, with the adoption date varying by county. This setting is a special case of the general Difference-InDifferences (DID) set up (e.g., Card [1990], Meyer et al. [1995], Angrist and Pischke [2008], Angrist and Krueger [2000], Abadie et al. [2010], Borusyak and Jaravel [2016], Athey and Imbens [2006], Card and Krueger [1994], Freyaldenhoven et al. [2018], de Chaisemartin and D'Haultf\u0153uille [2018], Abadie [2005]) where, at least in principle, units can switch back and forth between being exposed or not to the treatment. In this SAD setting we are concerned with identification issues as well as estimation and inference. In contrast to most of the DID literature, e.g., Bertrand et al. [2004], Shah et al. [1977], Conley and Taber [2011], Donald and Lang [2007], Stock and Watson [2008], Arellano [1987, 2003], Abraham and Sun [2018], Wooldridge [2010], de Chaisemartin and D'Haultf\u0153uille [2017, 2018], we take a design-based perspective where the stochastic nature and properties of the estimators arises from the stochastic nature of the assignment of the treatments, rather than a sampling-based perspective where the uncertainty arises from the random sampling of units from a large population. Such a design perspective is common in the analysis of randomized experiments, e.g., Neyman [1923/1990], Rosenbaum [2002, 2017]. See also Aronow and Samii [2016], Abadie et al. [2016, 2017] for this approach in cross-section regression settings. This perspective is particularly attractive in the current setting when the sample comprises the entire population, e.g., all states of the US, or all countries of the world. Our critical assumptions involve restrictions on the assignment process as well as exclusion restrictions, but in general do not involve functional form assumptions. Commonly made common trend assumptions (de Chaisemartin and D'Haultf\u0153uille [2018], Abraham and Sun [2018]) follow from some of our assumptions, but are not the starting point.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3124742002"},"_input_hash":324959696,"_task_hash":385473310,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734042330,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

We then investigate the interpretation of the standard DID estimator under assumptions about the assignment of the adoption date and under various exclusion restrictions. We show that under a random adoption date assumption, the standard DID estimator can be interpreted as the weighted average of several types of causal effects; within our framework, these concern the impact of different types of changes in the adoption date of the units. We also consider design-based inference for this estimand. We derive the exact variance of the DID estimator in this setting. We show that under a random adoption date assumption the standard Liang-Zeger (LZ) variance estimator (Liang and Zeger [1986], Bertrand et al. [2004]), or the clustered bootstrap, are conservative.

Recent work suggests that eyetracking can be used as a window through which one can study the process of mental simulation in intuitive physics tasks. In our experiment, participants have to figure out in which of three holes a ball was dropped in a virtual Plinko box. We develop a computational model of human intuitive physical reasoning in Plinko that runs repeated simulations in a noisy physics simulator in order to infer in which hole the ball was dropped. We evaluate our model's behavior against multiple human data signals: trial judgments, response times, and eyemovement data.

We proceed to introduce a sequential sampling model, that builds on this prior approach to better characterize the cognitive process at work in the Plinko task. We then introduce the task and discuss how well the different models account for the human data we collected. We highlight how sequential sampling helps us better explain participant behavior, capturing a strong trend in participant response time and skewed distributions of participant eye-movement. We close with a brief consideration of future directions.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4291821255"},"_input_hash":-630258091,"_task_hash":-260902713,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734042372,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"Following Gerstenberg, Siegel, and Tenenbaum (2021), we model physical inference by running repeated simulations in a noisy physics simulator. This approach builds on a broader literature that uses noisy physics engines as a model of human intuitive physical reasoning (Battaglia et al., 2013; Gerstenberg, Goodman, et al., 2021; Ullman et al., 2017). In general, people cannot perform exact mental physical simulation, and noisy simulators allow us to capture that uncertainty embedded in the cognitive process. Uncertainty in mental physical simulations arises from many sources (Smith & Vul, 2012). We model physical uncertainty in Plinko using two sources of noise: 1) uncertainty in the angle at which the ball is dropped from a hole ('drop noise'), and 2) uncertainty in the ball's magnitude of velocity after it collides with an obstacle or the wall ('collision noise'). Gerstenberg, Siegel, and Tenenbaum (2021) showed that these two sources of uncertainty were sufficient for accurately capturing participants' predictions and inferences in Plinko. 'Drop noise' is implemented by adding Gaussian noise to the true angle of the drop, while 'collision noise' is implemented by multiplying the ball's true exit velocity with a value generated from a Gaussian distribution. The parameters for these distributions are set to the same values used by Gerstenberg, Siegel, and Tenenbaum (2021) in their original study: N drop noise ( 0 , 0 . 2 ) and N collision noise ( 0 . 8 , 0 . 2 ) . The mean value of 'collision noise' is below 1 to capture participants' systematic tendency to underestimate how far the ball will bounce off the obstacles.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4291821255"},"_input_hash":325522817,"_task_hash":-517149939,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734042376,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

The uniform sampler (which runs the same number of simulations from each hole) was able to capture participants' judgments. However, it didn't account well for participants' response times, or their eye-movements. In contrast, the sequential sampler did a better job of capturing all three data signals. The sequential sampler runs simulations one by one, whereby its choice of what simulation to run next is guided by a trade-off between maximizing reward (i.e. simulating drops from holes where the ball ends up close to where it actually was) and minimizing uncertainty (i.e. considering holes it hasn't explored before).","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4291821255"},"_input_hash":1035211139,"_task_hash":-553254075,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734042405,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}
{"text":"The sequential sampler makes a first step toward a more complete process model of how people arrive at their inferences about what happened. In the future, we would like to capture not only aggregated eye-data but also the specific eyemovements that participants produce (including fixations and saccades). Currently, the eye-data that our models produce don't really play a causal role in the inference. However, we believe that people use their eye-movements to systematically reduce perceptual uncertainty about the position and rotation of the obstacles, as well as dynamic uncertainty about how the ball would fall from a hole.

Gerstenberg, Siegel, and Tenenbaum (2021) explored how participants combined visual and auditory evidence in their causal inferences. Participants first heard the sounds that the ball made when it was dropped into an occluded box. The cover was then revealed so that participants saw the final position of the ball. It will be interesting to explore how this auditory information affects the process by which people are considering different hypotheses over time. For example, it is plausible that participants may use the sounds to quickly rule out certain hypothesis ('I heard a collision so the hole must have an obstacle underneath.'), and then rely on more detailed mental simulations to differentiate between the remaining hypotheses.

{"text":"The Cdk-Rb-E2F pathway integrates external and internal signals to control progression at the G1/S transition of the mammalian cell cycle. Alterations in this pathway are found in the vast majority of human cancers and specific Cdk4/6 inhibitors are approved or in clinical trials for the treatment of diverse cancers. In the long-standing paradigm for G1/S control, Cdks inactivate Rb through phosphorylation, which releases E2F transcription factors to drive cell-cycle progression from G1 to S. However, recent observations in the laboratory and clinic challenge central tenets of the current paradigm and demonstrate that our understanding of the Rb pathway and G1/S control is still incomplete. Here, we integrate these recent findings with the previous paradigm to synthesize a current molecular and cellular view of the mammalian G1/S transition.

{"text":"The cellular decision to transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle is critical to normal development and is necessarily misregulated in cancer. During G1, cells decide to either enter the cell cycle, initiate DNA replication, and divide, or to exit the cell cycle and enter quiescence, senescence or differentiation. The G1/S transition is controlled by Cyclindependent kinases (Cdks), the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (Rb), and E2F transcription factors (Figure 1A). These components are typically assembled into a linear pathway, in which the upstream Cdk inhibits Rb to drive E2F-dependent transcription and cell-cycle progression. Abrogation of the G1/S control point is a hallmark of cancer and typically occurs through loss of Rb or through hyper-activation of Cdks (Burkhart and Sage, 2008; Kent and Leone, 2019; Malumbres and Barbacid, 2009; Otto and Sicinski, 2017). Importantly, the linear understanding of how the G1/S transition is controlled by the CdkRb-E2F pathway has led to the development of Cdk4 and Cdk6 (Cdk4/6) kinase inhibitors for cancer therapy (O'Leary et al., 2016; Otto and Sicinski, 2017; Sherr et al., 2016).

{"text":"Despite the progress over the past several decades, important questions remain. While the canonical G1/S pathway is understood as linear (Figure 1A), regulation is still quite complex. There are multiple homologous proteins for each pathway component, each protein is subject to post-translational modifications, and there are critical positive and negative feedback loops that connect the different pathway components (Figure 1B) (for past reviews see (Bertoli et al., 2013; Burkhart and Sage, 2008; Dick and Rubin, 2013; Kent and Leone, 2019; Sherr and Roberts, 1999). As a consequence, the field still struggles to define the critical molecular interactions and activities leading to Rb inactivation and the timing of those mechanisms relative to passage through G1 and into S phase. Moreover, it remains unclear how upstream growth signals feed into the pathway to coordinate cell growth with division, one of the earliest identified functions of G1/S regulation. Finally, there is a need to understand the variable responses to Cdk4/6 inhibitors observed both in the partial arrest of cells cultured in vitro and in the diverse outcomes of patients in clinical trials. According to the textbook linear model, inhibition of the upstream Cdk complexes should arrest cell division. That it often does not implies that there is a lot we do not know about the G1/S transition. Here, we review recent progress in understanding these important aspects of G1/S control in mammalian cells.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3087573264"},"_input_hash":-714168635,"_task_hash":-657895073,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734042441,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}
{"text":"The most critical event that marks the transition from G1 to S is the activation of a transcription program regulated by E2F transcription factors (Kent and Leone, 2019). Toward the end of G1, activating members of the E2F family stimulate expression of a set of hundreds of genes that promote DNA replication and enforce irreversible progression into the cell cycle (Bertoli et al., 2013; DeGregori et al., 1995). This E2F activity driving entry into S phase is restricted by Rb family proteins, which form repressive complexes with E2F proteins on the promoters of the S phase genes. Repression is relieved by Cdk phosphorylation of Rb proteins, which takes place on up to 15 sites and drives structural changes in Rb that lead to E2F dissociation (Dick and Rubin, 2013). Accordingly, a hallmark of the G1/S transition is the hyperphosphorylation of Rb that necessarily precedes DNA synthesis.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3087573264"},"_input_hash":-1425428801,"_task_hash":-251678297,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734042441,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}
{"text":"The requirement of Rb inactivation for G1/S progression has motivated studies to define the mechanisms by which Cdk complexes phosphorylate Rb and by other means regulate the G1/S transition. In the prevailing model, Cdk4/6-CycD is first to phosphorylate Rb. Then, later in G1, Cdk2-CycE completes phosphorylation to release and fully activate E2F (Figure 2, Model I). This model is supported by the timing of cyclin expression through G1, some reported evidence for specificity of the kinases for non-overlapping phosphorylation sites in Rb, and experiments inhibiting Cdk4/6 or Cdk2 activity (Harbour et al., 1999; Lundberg and Weinberg, 1998). The understanding that Rb phosphorylation is ordered in this manner also fits with models for how Cdk4/6 and then Cdk2 activity gradually increase throughout G1. Two mechanisms explain how Cdk4/6-CycD itself induces the increase in Cdk2-CycE activity.

{"text":"Estimating pandemic excess death burden is difficult, even in countries with excellent death registration systems, because estimates depend on many assumptions. 1,2 In countries with deficient death registration, one option is to make inferences from cohorts where death data are hopefully complete. One approach is to use cohorts of members of prestigious academies, where birth and death dates are recorded for their members. This approach was widely popularized when in 2023 a highly-read New York Times article 3 noticed that deaths of Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE) and Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) members peaked during December 2022 and January 2023. Linked to explosive spread of COVID-19 in Mainland China after removal of restrictive measures, deaths of academicians were believed to reflect the magnitude of excess death toll across Mainland China. This concept adopted in a meticulous epidemiological study concluded from CAE death data that the urban-dwelling population of Mainland China had 917,000 excess deaths during these two months. 4 The current analysis dissects the validity of this approach using data from different academies and from Nobel laureates.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4393156923"},"_input_hash":1657733872,"_task_hash":-312337389,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734042470,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"How different racial minorities experience racism differently remains underexplored in existing research. Here, we show that Asian and Black people are often dehumanized differently. Twelve studies spotlight a racial asymmetry in dehumanization using a wide array of methods (experimental, archival, and computational) and data sources (online samples, word embeddings, and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data): whereas Black people are more often subjected to animalistic dehumanization, Asian people are predominantly subjected to mechanistic dehumanization. We demonstrate this asymmetry from the vantage point of victims (Studies 1a and 1b) and perpetrators (Studies 2a-2d). We further document the prevalence of this asymmetry across diverse domains, from everyday language (Study 3) to perceptions in the realms of romantic relationships (Study 4a), crime rates (Study 4b), and business skills (Study 4c). Finally, we demonstrate the asymmetry's realworld consequences in labor market segregation (Studies 5 and 6). Our findings shed light on the distinct experiences of racism encountered by different racial groups, and more critically, introduce a framework that unifies and integrates scattered empirical observations on perceptions of Asian people.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3163386873"},"_input_hash":-729502765,"_task_hash":-1121261206,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734042490,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"Abstract -Autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) systems represent a rapidly developing mode of transportation wherein travel requests are dynamically handled by a coordinated fleet of robotic, self-driving vehicles. Given a graph representation of the transportation network - one where, for example, nodes represent areas of the city, and edges the connectivity between them - we argue that the AMoD control problem is naturally cast as a node-wise decision-making problem. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning framework to control the rebalancing of AMoD systems through graph neural networks. Crucially, we demonstrate that graph neural networks enable reinforcement learning agents to recover behavior policies that are significantly more transferable, generalizable, and scalable than policies learned through other approaches. Empirically, we show how the learned policies exhibit promising zero-shot transfer capabilities when faced with critical portability tasks such as inter-city generalization, service area expansion, and adaptation to potentially complex urban topologies.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4226047880"},"_input_hash":1442360490,"_task_hash":379474123,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734042533,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"The third and most relevant category for this work employs learning-based approaches to devise efficient algorithms without significantly compromising optimality [7][10]. Gueriau et al. [8] developed RL-based decentralized approaches where the action of each vehicle is determined independently through a Q-learning policy. Although these approaches are computationally efficient, the system performance may be sacrificed due to the lack of coordination. Holler et al. [9] developed a cooperative multi-agent approach for order dispatching and vehicle rebalancing using Deep Q-Networks [11] and Proximal Policy Optimization [12]. Nevertheless, the action of only one vehicle is determined at each time step due to computation tractability, which might lead to myopic solutions. Fluri et al. [10] developed a cascaded Q-learning approach to operate AMoD systems in a centralized manner. The cascaded structure significantly reduces the number of state-action pairs, allowing more efficient learning. However, by only considering the current vehicle distribution, this approach may not perform well in scenarios with time-varying travel demand and dynamic traffic conditions, where taking reactive decisions might be sub-optimal. Overall, although the aforementioned RL-based works cover a wide range of algorithms, there lacks a discussion on how to define neural network architectures able to exploit the graph structure present in urban transportation networks. In this work, we argue that exploiting the graph structure can represent a new direction for addressing relevant challenges such as transferring learning beyond the training conditions and learning from small amounts of experience.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4226047880"},"_input_hash":-384424437,"_task_hash":1366430057,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734042553,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

Specifically, in this simulation experiment, we select the pre-trained policy on Chengdu data, and examine its zero-shot performance when deployed in New York's transportation network, and viceversa. Without any fine-tuning, the only possibility of an effective rebalancing policy to emerge is for the agent to have learned a high-level, abstract and generalizable understanding of the system dynamics. Tables I and II show the adaptation performance (A2C-GNN-0Shot) when deploying the New York policy on Chengdu, and vice-versa. The results show that that rebalancing policies recovered by independently training on a single city exhibit an interesting degree of inter-city portability.

Nevertheless, these articles have studied only a limited set of outcome variables. Most published work concerns either how selection method affects (1) judicial responsiveness to public opinion or (2) ideological direction. To my knowledge, however, no empirical work explores how choice of selection method impacts ideological extremity. This paper fills that gap. Using generalized propensity score matching, fixed effects counterfactual estimators, and synthetic controls to conduct causal inference, I examine whether some methods of selection produce more moderate (or extreme) judges than others. In order to do so, I extend and supplement the Bonica-Woodruff dataset on state supreme court judges, which features a commonly used measure of judicial ideology extracted from political donations.

{"text":"latter component assumes special importance since a reduction of the seismic vulnerability (e.g., retrofitting interventions) can cause a direct decrease of the associated earthquake risk. In the last three decades, dozens of methodologies have been proposed for the analytical derivation of fragility  and  vulnerability  functions,  with  varying  levels  of  complexity  and  accuracy  (e.g., D'Ayala et  al .  2014,  Pitilakis et  al. 2014).  Each  methodology  will  inevitably  lead  to  distinct vulnerability and fragility functions, even if an identical building class is considered (e.g., Silva et  al .  2014a; Pitlakis 2015). It is thus fundamental to understand the limitations and potential bias  in  the  existing  practice,  and  explore  solutions  to  increase  the  reliability  of  the  resulting functions. As an example, Figure 1 illustrates yielding and collapse fragility functions for nonductile European reinforced concrete moment frames, collected from 24 studies (Crowley et al . 2014). These functions represent structures mostly built before the implementation of modern seismic  regulations.  Apart  from  variations  due  to  site-specific  conditions  and/or  different structural designs, these functions represent a similar building class, and thus a lower variability in  the  fragility  functions  would  be  expected.  However,  these  results  indicate  coefficients  of variation in the median yielding and collapse probability in the order of 60%, and a range of mean collapse probability for PGA equal to 0.5g between 5% and 100%.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W2941345678"},"_input_hash":1910896328,"_task_hash":105889911,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734042623,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

Amongst the various decisions that a modeler has to undertake in implementing an analytical vulnerability derivation procedure, it is reasonable to identify the selection of the set of seismic inputs, the development of the numerical model, the estimation  of  the  structural  response  and  the  statistical  regression  approach  as  the  most influential steps.

{"text":"Musculoskeletal geometry and muscle volumes vary widely in the population and are intricately linked to the performance of tasks ranging from walking and running to jumping and sprinting. However, our ability to understand how these parameters affect task performance has been limited due to the high computational cost of modelling the necessary complexity of the musculoskeletal system and solving the requisite multi-dimensional optimization problem. For example, sprinting and running are fundamental to many forms of sport, but past research on the relationships between musculoskeletal geometry, muscle volumes, and running performance has been limited to observational studies, which have not established cause-effect relationships, and simulation studies with simplified representations of musculoskeletal geometry. In this study, we developed a novel musculoskeletal simulator that is differentiable with respect to musculoskeletal geometry and muscle volumes. This simulator enabled us to find the optimal body segment dimensions and optimal distribution of added muscle volume for sprinting and marathon running. Our simulation results replicate experimental observations, such as increased muscle mass in sprinters, as well a mass in the lower end of the healthy BMI range and a higher leg-length-to-height ratio in marathon runners. The simulations also reveal new relationships, for example showing that hip musculature is vital to both sprinting and marathon running. We found hip flexor and extensor moment arms were maximized to optimize sprint and marathon running performance, and hip muscles the main target when we simulated strength training for sprinters. Our simulation results can help sprint and marathon runners customize strength training, and our simulator can be extended to other athletic tasks,","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4385622138"},"_input_hash":1250509472,"_task_hash":-663305247,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734042663,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"Musculoskeletal simulation could allow researchers to quantify the effects of variations in body segment dimensions and muscle properties on performance. Simulation allows us to observe the influence of variables that cannot be changed in an experiment (e.g., the height of a runner) and enables us to examine whether specific muscular and skeletal features that have been associated with the performance of a task causally contribute to task performance. Previous simulation studies have opened the door to this possibility but have been limited by simplified representations of the musculoskeletal system [4-6]. The majority use gradient-based trajectory optimization, which requires gradient computations that are computationally expensive because there are typically non-differentiable expressions requiring the use of finite differentiation [7]. To understand the effects of body segment dimensions and muscle properties on task performance using finite differentiation to compute gradients will lead to days or weeks of computation time. Falisse et al. [8] enabled automatic differentiation, a faster alternative to finite differentiation, for musculoskeletal simulation, by replacing non-differentiable expressions by differentiable alternatives. However, the algorithm requires body segment dimensions and muscle properties to be fixed. Our simulator can optimize both body segment dimensions and muscle volumes of a complex, three-dimensional muscle-driven musculoskeletal model for a range tasks. By implementing a musculoskeletal simulator that is fully differentiable with respect to both body segment dimensions and muscle volumes, we have enabled simulations to be completed within hours on a standard computer. To exercise this new simulator, we used it to study the role of body segment dimensions and muscle volumes in sprinting and marathon running performance.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4385622138"},"_input_hash":861455033,"_task_hash":2082611303,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734042666,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"We develop an analytical framework to study experimental design in two-sided marketplaces. Many of these experiments exhibit interference , where an intervention applied to one market participant influences the behavior of another participant. This interference leads to biased estimates of the treatment effect of the intervention. We develop a stochastic market model and associated mean field limit to capture dynamics in such experiments, and use our model to investigate how the performance of different designs and estimators is affected by marketplace interference effects. Platforms typically use two common experimental designs: demand-side 'customer' randomization ( CR ) and supply-side 'listing' randomization ( LR ), along with their associated estimators. We show that good experimental design depends on market balance: in highly demandconstrained markets, CR is unbiased, while LR is biased; conversely, in highly supply-constrained markets, LR is unbiased, while CR is biased. We also introduce and study a novel experimental design based on two-sided randomization ( TSR ) where both customers and listings are randomized to treatment and control. We show that appropriate choices of TSR designs can be unbiased in both extremes of market balance, while yielding relatively low bias in intermediate regimes of market balance.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3040914334"},"_input_hash":851648003,"_task_hash":1919568704,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734042676,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

Yet, despite demonstrating signi cantly larger effect sizes than wait-list controls, psychopharmacological medications, or supportive therapy (average effect size = 0.43, n.s.; 8), up to two-thirds of individuals retain a PTSD diagnosis following trauma-focused therapy (9, 10).","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4286353196"},"_input_hash":2074760197,"_task_hash":-227375207,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734042706,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}
{"text":"Emotion regulation (ER) is a key process underlying many mental health disorders, including PTSD (11). ER is a broad construct that encompasses awareness, comprehension (across cognitive, physiological, and behavioural manifestations), and adaptive and contextually appropriate responding to emotional experiences (11-14), which may be either voluntary/intentional or automatic (15). Many of the symptoms of PTSD manifest as poor ER (often called 'emotion dysregulation'; e.g., hyperarousal to threat, poor regulation of negative emotional states such as sadness or anger) (1) and a growing body of evidence highlights the role of ER in the development and maintenance of PTSD (16) and emotional disorders more broadly (11).

Objective, biological methods increase ecological validity, inform mechanisms of pathology, and are an important adjunct to self-report measures. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a well-validated biomarker of ER capacity and  exibility in healthy adults (20, 21) and psychopathology more broadly (22) as well as PTSD speci cally (23, 24). Lower resting levels of HRV are proposed to re ect autonomic in exibility and a vulnerability toward maladaptive responses to stressful or emotionally evocative experiences (25) (i.e., di culties in ER). Indeed, studies of healthy adults demonstrate inverse relationships between self-reported di culties in ER and both resting-state HRV (26) and ambulatory 24-hr HRV (27).

We present secondary exploratory analyses from a recently completed randomised controlled trial (RCT) showing that a breathing-based yoga practice (Sudarshan kriya yoga; SKY) was not clinically inferior to CPT at end-of-treatment for symptoms of PTSD, depression, and negative affect among US Veterans (29). Self-reported ER (the Di culties in Emotion Regulation Scale; DERS) and 5-min at-rest (sleep time) HRV (which we refer to here as 'physiological ER') were collected at baseline and end-of-treatment. Based on the primary outcomes study  ndings, we hypothesised that both self-reported and physiological ER would improve to a healthier pro le with both CPT and SKY for PTSD (Hypothesis A). We also explored whether there were group treatment differences in multi-modal ER (Hypothesis B). On one hand, one might hypothesise greater changes in self-reported ER following CPT and greater changes in physiological ER following SKY, based on their speci c targeted actions on intentional (11-14) and automatic regulation (30-33), respectively. Alternatively, given extant literature demonstrating inverse relationships between self-reported di culties in ER and HRV (26-28), one might hypothesise that regardless of whether the treatment targets conscious/intentional or automatic regulation, these treatment actions will manifest similarly in both self-reported and physiological ER across treatment groups.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4286353196"},"_input_hash":-454838028,"_task_hash":1068435110,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734042708,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"The association between peak systolic blood pressure (SBP) during exercise testing and outcome remains controversial, possibly due to the confounding effect of external workload (METs) on peak SBP as well as on survival. Indexing the increase in SBP to the increase in workload (SBP/MET-slope) could provide a more clinically relevant measure of the SBP response to exercise.

{"text":"The production of waste as a consequence of human activities is one of the most fundamental challenges facing our society and global ecological systems 1-4 . Waste generation is rapidly increasing 5 , with corresponding shifts in the structure of our societies where almost all nations are moving from rural agrarian societies to urban and technological ones 6,7 . However, the connections between these radical societal shifts and waste generation have not yet been described.  Here we apply scaling theory 8-11 to establish a new understanding of waste in urban systems.  We identify universal scaling laws of waste generation across diverse urban systems worldwide for three forms of waste: wastewater, municipal solid waste, and greenhouse gasses.  We show that wastewater generation scales superlinearly, municipal solid waste scales linearly, and greenhouse gasses scales sublinearly with city size.  In specific cases production can be understood in terms of city size coupled with financial and natural resources. For example, wastewater generation can be understood in terms of the increased economic activity of larger cities, and the deviations around the scaling relationship - indicating relative efficiency - depend on GDP per person and local rainfall. We also show how the temporal evolution of these scaling relationships reveals a loss of economies of scale and the general increase in waste production, where sublinear scaling relationships become linear.  Our findings suggest general mechanisms controlling waste generation across diverse cities and global urban systems. Our approach offers a systematic approach to uncover these underlying mechanisms that might be key to reducing waste and pursing a more sustainable future.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4292847294"},"_input_hash":980208228,"_task_hash":-1864704587,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734042766,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

Forecasting carries a rich literature, offering a wide range of sophisticated techniques, see, e.g., [6] for a review; however, we purposely avoid enhancements such as order selection, correction of outliers/anomalies in the data, and inclusion of regularization or nonlinearities. Similarly, we do not account for other factors that may well aid in forecasting, such as age-specific effects, holiday adjustments, and the effects of public health mandates. All that said, despite its simplicity, the basic autoregressive model that we consider in this paper exhibits competitive performance (see the Supplementary Materials for details) with many of the top COVID-19 case forecasters submitted to the U.S. COVID-19 Forecast Hub [7], which is the official source of forecasts used in public communications by the U.S. CDC.

Note that even lagged correlations cannot deliver a complete answer. Demonstrating utility for prediction is a much higher standard than simply asking about correlations; to be useful in forecast or hotspot models, an indicator must provide relevant information that is not otherwise contained in past values of the case rate series itself (cf. the pioneering work on Granger causality [9, 10], as well as the further references given below).

{"text":"Ketamine  is  a  non-competitive  antagonist  of  the  N-methyl-D-aspartate  (NMDA)  glutamate receptor that is both a drug of abuse and an FDA-approved anesthetic used off-label for treatmentresistant depression. Despite its growing clinical use for depression and pain, the relationships between  the  acute  dissociative  and  affective  effects  of  ketamine  that  contribute  to  its  abuse liability and therapeutic potential, along with the neural mechanisms underlying these effects, are not well established. To address this need, we have implemented a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, within-subjects mechanistic trial. Healthy adult subjects undergo infusion with two fixed doses of subanesthetic racemic intravenous (IV) ketamine and placebo and their acute responses are assessed with self-report questionnaires, behavioral measures, hormone levels, and neuroimaging. As planned in our analysis strategy, we present interim results for the first 7 subjects of our study, focusing on dissociative and affective states and resting functional brain coupling  signatures  of  these  states.  The  first  key  finding  was  that  ketamine  induced  dosedependent  increases  in  dissociation  and  related  intoxication.  Ketamine  also  altered  affective states,  reducing  emotional  insensitivity  but  increasing  stress  assessed  by  cortisol.  Second, ketamine had an effect on altering brain connectivity, particularly for specific connections between regions  of  the  reward  and  negative  affect  circuits  and  involving  thalamic  sub-regions.  Third, regarding brain-response associations, ketamine-induced increases in amygdala-anteroventral thalamus coupling were correlated with greater dissociation and intoxication, whereas decreases in the coupling of the anteromedial thalamus and posterior parietal thalamus were correlated with increased  sensory  aspects  of  reward  responsiveness.  Additional  specific  correlations  were observed between affective measures relevant to reward  responsiveness or its absence and drug-altered  changes  in  localized  functional  connections  involving  the  nucleus  accumbens (NAcc), amygdala, and thalamic sub-regions. We also discovered a consistent profile of negative associations between ketamine altered connectivity involving the NAcc and specific thalamic subregions and effects of anxiety. Further, drug-altered increases in the coupling of the amygdala and anteroventral thalamus were associated with increases in cortisol, an indicator of biochemical stress.  The  findings  highlight  the  utility  of  integrating  self-reports,  objective  measures,  and functional  neuroimaging  to  disentangle  the  brain  states  underlying  specific  acute  responses induced  by  ketamine.  With  the  likely  continued  expansion  of  FDA  indications  for  ketamine, understanding acute responses and underlying neural mechanisms is important for maximizing the therapeutic potential of ketamine while minimizing the risk of promoting misuse or abuse of this substance.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3200057161"},"_input_hash":-404988867,"_task_hash":741899932,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734042797,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}
{"text":"Ketamine  is  a  non-competitive  antagonist  of  the  N-methyl-D-aspartate  (NMDA)  glutamate receptor and an FDA-approved dissociative anesthetic that was introduced into clinical practice in the US in the 1960's as a novel agent that could produce effective sedation and analgesia while maintaining cardiorespiratory stability [1]. By the late 1970's, ketamine had become a heavily abused substance throughout the world. By the turn of the 21 st century, subanesthetic doses of ketamine began to show promise as a breakthrough, fast acting therapy for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Throughout the 2000's, ketamine has increasingly been used as an off-label therapy  for  TRD,  especially  among  suicidal  patients  [2],  with  its  use  rising  further  after  FDA approval  of  intranasal  esketamine  in  March  2019  for  TRD  in  adults  and  in  August  2020  for depressive symptoms in adults with major depressive disorder with acute suicidal ideation or behavior.

{"text":"One of the key acute experiences that ketamine induces is dissociation, which is broadly defined as feelings of disconnection from one's body and/or environment. In the context of ketamine, it may include a general sensory detachment, mind-body uncoupling, and feelings of floating in the absence of delirium [3, 4]. While challenging to obtain estimates of the prevalence of dissociation in  abuse  settings,  this  effect  is  known  to  commonly  occur  at doses  therapeutic  for  TRD.  For example, in short-term phase III trials of esketamine for those aged 18-64 years old, 27% of subjects  (total  n  =  346)  experienced  dissociation  [5].  Anecdotally,  dissociation  is  noted  as  a reason for abusing ketamine, along with hallucinations and feelings of intoxication, which is a broad  term  that,  for  ketamine,  can  include  mild  euphoria  that  has  been  likened  to  alcohol intoxication as well as feelings of calmness and sedation. Some individuals experience ketamineinduced dissociation associated with positive affective states, whereas for others, including those who do not like the sense of loss of control, it induces negative affective states [6]. There is mixed evidence  as  to  whether  dissociation  is  necessary  for  ketamine's  antidepressant  effect.  For example, a meta-analysis showed it was not necessary [7], whereas another study demonstrated a  correlation  between  reduction  in  depression  scores  and  the  depersonalization  aspect  of ketamine-induced dissociation in particular [8].","meta":{"openalex_id":"W3200057161"},"_input_hash":1550036522,"_task_hash":-35715279,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734042798,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

{"text":"The presence of dark states causes fluorescence intermittency of single molecules due to transitions between 'on' and 'off' states. Genetically encodable markers such as fluorescent proteins (FPs) exhibit dark states that  make  several  super-resolved  single-molecule  localization  microscopy  (SMLM)  methods  possible. However, studies quantifying the timescales and nature of dark state behavior for commonly used FPs under conditions typical of widefield and total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy remain scarce and pre-date many new SMLM techniques. FusionRed is a relatively bright red FP exhibiting fluorescence intermittency and has thus been identified as a potential candidate for SMLM. We herein characterize the rates for dark-state conversion and the subsequent ground-state recovery of FusionRed and its 2.5-fold brighter descendent FusionRed L175M M42Q (FusionRed-MQ) at low irradiances (1-10 W/cm 2 ), which were previously unexplored experimental conditions.  We characterized the kinetics of dark state transitions in these two FPs by using single molecule blinking and ensemble photobleaching experiments bridged with a  dark  state  kinetic  model.  We find that at low irradiances, the recovery process to the ground state is minimally light-driven and FusionRed-MQ has a 1.3-fold higher ground state recovery time indicating a conformationally restricted dark-state chromophore in comparison to FusionRed. Our studies indicate that the brighter FusionRed-MQ exhibits higher tendency in dark state conversion, thus it is potentially a better candidate for SMLM applications than its progenitor FusionRed.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4206398787"},"_input_hash":-1786558000,"_task_hash":1432265530,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734042828,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

A majority of  the  literature  treats  emitters  simply  as  tools,  with  limited  analysis  of  their  dark  state  kinetics  and photophysics. 23-25 Unwanted artefacts in the determination of spatial locations for these emitters can thus arise, as a major assumption underlying such stochastic methods is that the signals from single fluorophores are additive as long as the fluorescence dynamics of the molecules are independent. 25","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4206398787"},"_input_hash":814107954,"_task_hash":1838359799,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734042829,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}
{"text":"Genetically encoded fluorophores, such as fluorescent proteins (FPs), are popular and powerful choices to image biological systems and often exhibit dark molecular states which manifest in stochastic blinking behavior at the single molecule level. 26-30 Extensive mechanistic studies have elucidated a diverse range of mechanisms  and  timescales  for  stochastic  and  tuned  dark-state  conversion,  including  electron-transfer reactions, excited-state proton transfer, chromophore and sidechain conformational changes. For example, a number of proteins from the avGFP line display a spontaneous, light-driven, pH-dependent dark-state conversion pathway. 31-33 In such cases a pH-dependent dark state conversion is often attributed to a proton transfer between amino acid residues and the chromophore. The red FP (RFP) DsRed exhibits a similar light-driven  dark-state  conversion  through  a  different,  pH-independent  process. 32 Photoconvertible  FPs (PCFPs)  like  IrisFP,  mEosFP  and  Dendra  derivatives  exhibit  dark-state  conversion  via  chromophore distortions due to side-chain conformational changes, chromophore twisting motions or by proton transfer from  the  triplet  or  a  radical  ground  state. 34-38 Selectively  engineered  photo-switchable  or  reversiblyswitchable  fluorescent  proteins  (rsFPs)  exhibit  highly  efficient  transfer  to  the  dark  states,  allowing  the molecules  to  be  switched  on  and  off  with  either  light-driven  pH-dependent  pathways  or  reversible chromophore  conformational  changes  such  as  a cis-trans isomerization  along  the  methylidine  bridge connecting the two conjugated rings in the chromophore moiety. 39-41 Dark states can be selectively accessed or  depopulated  using  optical  or  thermal  modulation. 42-48 For  example,  pulsed  excitation  with  resonant frequencies  was  used  to  populate  and  depopulate  the  dark  state  in  FPs  like  AcGFP  and  rsFastLime,","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4206398787"},"_input_hash":76055669,"_task_hash":-366468932,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734042829,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

These conditions accelerate permanent photodegradation of the fluorophore, make extrapolation to much lower irradiance  as  in  widefield  and  SMLM  regimes  difficult,  and  cause  light-induced  photo-toxicity  and photodamage to  biological  systems. 18,49,50 It  is  also  worth  noting  that  blue  shifting  the  excitation  light increases  phototoxicity,  thus  highlighting  the  need  for  development  of  new  bright  and  red-shifted fluorophores as well as for detailed photophysical characterization of existing red fluorophores - which additionally allow for deeper imaging in comparison to blue shifted analogues. 50, 51 When extrapolating the rate constant of ground-state recovery (kGSR) at low irradiances from high irradiance measurements, kGSR is commonly assumed to be proportional to the excitation rate (kEx). 28, 52 Recovery from a dark to a fluorescent state  is  often  a  consequence  of  conformational  switching  such  as  a  dark-trans  to  fluorescent-cis isomerization  of  the  FP  chromophore. 53 Since  such  conformational  switches  are  often  energetically controlled, the excitation dependence of kGSR may originate from the absorption of the excitation photons by dark state species and/or the rise of local temperature due to high irradiance. 28, 52, 54","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4206398787"},"_input_hash":1072461830,"_task_hash":1423491792,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734042831,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}
{"text":"FusionRed and its sibling TagRFP-T exhibit fluorescence intermittency in live-cell imaging using TIRF microscopy with camera acquisition timescales of 50 ms. 55 The study demonstrated the potential to achieve a  theoretical  spatial  resolution  beyond the diffraction limit (~25-30 nm) with FusionRed using SMLM methods like  BALM and SOFI. 55 In  our  previous  work,  we  developed  FusionRed-MQV,  a  FusionRed variant  with  3-fold  higher  molecular  brightness  developed  using  a  combination  of  lifetime-based microfluidic selection and site-directed mutagenesis. 53 Additionally, we found that the substitution C159V in FusionRed resulted in a brighter variant which showed a monoexponential photobleaching trace contrary to  the  biexponential  behavior  exhibited  by  the  parental  RFP  FusionRed.  Variants  lacking  the  C159V substitution, like the 2.5-fold brighter FusionRed-MQ exhibited biexponential photobleaching traces with a fast fluorescence decay component (~s) followed by a significantly slower decay component (>100 s). 53 The faster component was attributed to reversible photobleaching, where fluorescent molecules are trapped in the dark state. 53 This was verified by employing a high-energy 438 nm pulse (~2 s; 50% duty) with a continuous 560 nm excitation scheme which resulted in distinct reversible photoswitching for FusionRed variants with a Cys residue at position 159. 53 High energy 438 nm light prompts a return to the fluorescent state from a dark state, suggesting that the lower energy 560 nm excitation minimally perturbs the ground state recovery process. 53 Together with findings and from other studies, including crystal structure data, indicate a possible interconversion of the FusionRed chromophore from a fluorescent cis to a dark trans isomer. 56, 57 Moreover, in the low irradiance regime of 1-10 W/cm 2 , the temperature increase in the vicinity of an FP molecule can be considered negligible. 58 Based on these observations, we hypothesized that the rate of recovery to the ground state (kGSR) is independent of the excitation rate (kEx) under low irradiances for FusionRed and FusionRed-MQ. To verify these claims, we explore the relatively uncharted territory of dark state kinetics of these two RFPs under low irradiances, central to widefield and SMLM techniques like SOFI. We do so by extracting on-off statistics with single molecule imaging and exploiting the kinetics of reversible photobleaching using widefield excitation on ensemble RFPs.

{"text":"We study the paths over time that individuals follow in the labor market, as revealed in the monthly Current Population Survey. Some people face much higher flow values from work than in a non-market activity; if they lose a job, they find another soon. Others have close to equal flow values and tend to circle through jobs, search, and nonmarket activities. And yet others have flow values for non-market activities that are higher than those in the market, and do not work. We develop a model that identifies and quantifies heterogeneity in dynamic individual behavior. Our model provides a bridge between research on monthly transition rates in the tradition of Blanchard and Diamond (1990) and research on economic dynamics in the tradition of Mortensen and Pissarides (1994). Our estimates discern 5 distinct types. Most unemployment comes from just two of those types. Low employment types frequently circle among unemployment, short-term jobs, and being out of the labor market. Short-term jobs play a role in the job-finding process related to the role of unemployment. These are stop-gap jobs for high-employment types and a part of circling for low-employment types. Because of their high job-finding rates, and despite their low flow values of nonwork relative to work, the volatility of the future lifetime value that high-employment types derive from work and non-work is lower than for low-employment types.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W2919371474"},"_input_hash":-701929011,"_task_hash":-1560676140,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734042848,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}

In this paper, we present a simplified VQGAN training scheme that is easily adapted with different input/output channels for imageto-image translation tasks.

However, the use of fluorescent probes in combination with the strong light needed to illuminate the fluorophore can introduce phototoxic effects and perturb cellular functions [1].

Conversely, label-free transmitted light (TL) microscopy offers a noninvasive alternative with reduced phototoxicity, yet it does not inherently provide the specific cellular insights offered by targeting molecules by fluorescence probes.

A more complex training dataset, including three imaging modalities, cell lines, and data generated in three labs, was presented in a study where a CNN autoencoder was trained to predict organelles from TL inputs [5]. Despite being diverse in modality and cell line, this training dataset was still acquired at the same pixel size (as designed for the study), which helped CNN based models to recognize and learn perceptive fields. A more generalizable approach is needed to make use of previous microscopy studies, either intended or not intended for this task, as the public dataset pool grows.","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4399283731"},"_input_hash":-1884335813,"_task_hash":19487447,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734042890,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}
{"text":"Overall, there is great interest to develop generalized computational tools that can provide molecular labels from TL image input, and to validate such models in the most comprehensive way possible to facilitate downstream applications. For these tools to be easily usable by biologists, they need to be robust across a wide range of acquisition protocols, irrespective of the size of the images, cell line, acquisition site, modality or instrument. In the light of this aim, ISBI2024 Light My Cell (LMC) challenge recently made public a large diverse and heterogeneous dataset, including 30+ studies from 23 data acquisition sites, three main TL imaging modalities, multiple imaging settings and cell lines. Additionally, the Joint Undertaking in Morphological Profiling (JUMP) Cell Painting Consortium also gathers and makes available a massive public CellPaint datasets [6]. These resources offer great opportunities to develop methodology aimed for greater generalizability across diverse biological specimens and imaging conditions. This paper outlines our first-place approach to the LMC challenge, using relatively light-weight generative models for image-to-image translation tasks. Our approach also surpassed metrics of the previously published label-free CellPaint [3] (albeit different dataset). The resulting models bring us a step closer to obtaining molecular readouts from non-invasive cellular imaging technology, offering profound opportunities","meta":{"openalex_id":"W4399283731"},"_input_hash":-551919835,"_task_hash":-394592600,"options":[{"id":"AFFILIATION","text":"AFFILIATION"},{"id":"AUTHOR","text":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"CITATION","text":"CITATION"}],"_view_id":"choice","accept":[],"config":{"choice_style":"multiple"},"answer":"accept","_timestamp":1734042891,"_annotator_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31","_session_id":"2024-12-12_13-43-31"}
